"Hello there! As an international student myself, I understand how difficult it might be to decide between two great universities like Columbia University and UNC Chapel Hill. Both schools have their own unique strengths - while UNC has a beautiful campus with a strong sports culture, Columbia offers unparalleled opportunities being located right in New York City. In terms of competitiveness, both schools are highly selective; however, Columbia's location gives its graduates access to top companies and internship programs.
