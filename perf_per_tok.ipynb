That is a general question I have for state flagships and the top 15. UW 75% 1450 SAT Yale 75% 1600 Yale 25% 1420 Without more data points,  it is hard to tell exactly, but you could interpolate and get close. I envision two overlapping bell curves with Yale’s shifted and elongated to the right. Anecdotally: The only kid who got into Yale from our HS in the past 7 years had a 1420 (Naviance makes it easy to figure this out). He had a 4.0 as do pretty much the top 10% of the class (my kid said he was very smart). FWIW, he had the “mother of all” non-sports ECs for Yale. His EC was off the charts for a high school kid. I have no doubt he could throw down a big GPA in either place.  ```\\n',\n",

It’s just a percentage of total addimision. Penn State is another one.  They’ve admitted students this current admission cycle to the main University Park campus with substantially lower stats than a lot of business and engineering pre-majors with higher stats. Instead, PSU pushed those kids off to branch campuses.  And the expection is that if you want to attend, don’t count on any aid.  ```\\n',\n",

The swimming pool is over at Bryn Mawr.  I would look much more carefully at Bryn Maur classes rather than Penn, as its more accessible.   The train is not very far to Penn, but more effort.   For a business major, math matters a lot.  The more math you take the more MBA programs or law programs will accept you, but does depend a little on your law or business goals.  ```\\n',\n",

The Stanford campus is huge, and  removed from town.  Students don’t live off campus or hang out off campus.  In fact, students rarely leave campus at all except to go on outings to San Francisco or maybe to the movies. tl/dr  Palo Alto has almost nothing in common with Ann Arbor, Madison, Cambridge or Hyde Park (but the weather is far nicer).  ```\\n',\n",

But if @gigichuck has concerns about the environment for persons of color at Dartmouth, perhaps they’d be the best ones to reach out to her to share their experiences (as your kid did about Amherst.)

The reputation of Hopkins being brutal for pre-med has for some reason persisted. Maybe it is not true as you say,  but I a far from the only one with this perception. Personally I have a few friends who did pre-med at Hopkins and they felt it was rather brutal. Also they food the physical environment rather stressful. Cornel and Hopkins definitely are more grade deflated and rough than Dartmouth though. The advantage for Hopkins as a pre-med is that you could also get involved in some great research as an undergrad and boost your med school application. As for the prestige point, definitely it is rather subjective, but for undergrad Hopkins has a lower yield rate (40.6%) than both Cornell (52.7%) and Dartmouth (51.4%) and tends to lose the cross admit battle with both. While this is not a perfect measure of prestige, it does reveal desirability to an extent. There is not a big actual different but Cornell and Dartmouth probably benefit because they are ivies.  ```\\n',\n",

As awesome as JHU is, it has a rep of being a grind for premeds.  JHU for med or residency.  Not so great for undergrads. Yale is tough on premeds as well.  I’ve told this story before.  When my son was a college freshman premed I ran into an old friend whose son was a freshman premed at Yale.  Her son was determined to go to med school and they were confident Yale would pave the way. The friend was aghast that my son was attending a mid-tier flagship and she voiced a lot of doubt about whether he’d get into a med school.  Fast forward a few years, her son’s GPA was not med-school worthy.  My son will be graduating from med school in May. Don’t believe the hype about Yale inflation and that everyone gets A’s in their classes.  Maybe it’s that way for other paths, but the premed prereqs are still weeder classes at Yale.  Like every other college in the nation, they must reduce the number of their premeds. As for UPitt @ucbalumnus is exactly right.  College is much harder than high school when in a serious major.  Adding premed path into the mix makes things even more difficult.  I have two premed parent forums and every fall parents are posting that their child-who’s-never-received-a-B-in-his-life is now struggling to bring his mid-semester C average in Gen Chem or Bio up to please-be-at-least-a-B.  These are kids who took the most rigorous high school schedules, took the zero period class, and were top 1-5% of their class. I’m a little shocked that the 3.75 GPA req’t is “per semester” and not evaluated at the end of the year.  Bio, chem, and physics classes are usually 4-5 credits per class and a B in one of them can sink a semester’s BCPM GPA even if the student gets A’s in the other BCPM courses he takes that semester. Considering that the Pitt program only takes the cream of the high school crop (poaching from Ivys), and 50% don’t make it thru, there’s reason to be concerned. Of course a Pitt student who gets booted from the program can still proceed as a premed, get GPA where it needs to be and apply to other med schools later.  BUT…the $20k per year EFC may be an issue to the family.  Is it?  [QUOTE=\"\"\"\"] [quote] [quote] ...may still get into a decent med school down the road. [/quote] [/quote] [/QUOTE]  Lol…I can’t let that sentence pass.  We don’t have any “decent” med schools in the US.  All of our med schools are excellent.  There are about 145 med schools in the USA.  They all teach the same things; the education is flat. Any premed should be thrilled to get into any of them.  No one is too good for any of them. My vote is for Yale. Cost-wise it’s better.  The Yale name will help if his career path changes.  Just remind him NOT to believe the Yale-hype about 90% of students get A’s.  That doesn’t apply to premed prereqs.  He’ll have to be self-disciplined.  Freshman have so many distractions and it’s their first time away from mom and dad. If he gets at least a 3.7 GPA at Yale and scores well on the MCAT (sounds like he’s a strong test taker anyway), and has medically related ECs and some research experiences, he’ll likely get into a med school.  As a Calif resident, he’ll need to apply broadly and include some Midwest privates since getting into a Calif med school is crazy difficult.  [QUOTE=\"\"\"\"] [quote] [quote] His ultimate goal is going medicine. Going with the Pitt\\'s GAP is obviously the way to achieve his goal in one-step shot in a top-10 med school, however, he is looking at about 20k/yr for four under graduate years (he\\'s awarded 20k scholarship but we have to pay the out-state tuition since we are from California), vs Yale offered a total package with only 5k EFC. The other thing bothers my son is that for the GAP you have to maintain a 3.75 for each semester (both overall and BCPM), which means if you miss one, you will be out from the guaranteed medical school admission and end up with a Pitt undergrad education for roughly a cost of 80k in four years, where with Yale you will earn a Ivy undergra education with far less cost and may still get to a decent med school down to the road.

Contrast that with out of state public school costs or what I call the “Stevens Dilemma” where a school like Stevens gives huge scholarship discounts to freshmen who fail to pull a 3.0 and thereafter lose that mo ru.  ```\\n',\n",

This is not directly related to your ability to afford college, maybe, but it could be, and it certainly could improve your ability to have fun in college and provide for your future: Let’s say you took a 15-hr (per week) job making $10/hour. Let’s say you’re at Nebraska and the state/local taxes are low-to-nil, so you’re keeping about $130 of that per week. That comes to about $550 per month (since months average more than four full weeks). If you adopted a “spend half, save half” mentality, you could:  Spend an average of $65 per week. That could buy you five pizzas, or two pizzas and two movies, or two cheap dates, or one fancy date – every week. You could buy a soda now and then, chips, candy bar, whatever. Aside from adding some “fun/food money” to your college experience, it would also teach you how to plan and execute a budget, which is a valuable thing to learn. A lot of people don’t know how to do that, go into credit card and other types of debt, and it causes major problems. Save an average of $65 per week. If you are on campus for 34 weeks out of the year, that’s right around $2200 in savings. Or maybe you spend a little less or make a little more money, so you’re saving $2500 per year. At graduation, you’d have $10,000.  That $10,000 is $10,000 worth of access to opportunity and added security. It can help you put down a down payment on a house, it can come in handy if you are out of work for months, you can take a piece of it and do some traveling, etc.  ```\\n',\n",

[/quote]  Not sure why that would be a Stevens-specific issue.  Any scholarship at any college that requires a high college GPA to renew could have this issue.  Obviously, how big of an issue depends on the GPA.  For top-end scholarships that require a 3.0, it is likely that few students lose them (after all, they had to have been at the top-end of the entering class to get the top-end scholarships).  But if the GPA minimum is something like 3.5, that can be more of an issue, since students have to protect their GPAs like pre-meds do.  ```\\n',\n",

The entire enrollment was only about 2,000 students. Once a University reaches the realm of “street talk” famous, exaggeration sets in and  many assumptions lead to a mythology. There are many remarkable colleges and universities out there!  They did not all come from the Ivies, MIT and Cal Tech. @1NJParent Agree, it takes more than thermodynamics classes to develop an effective leader!

It’s a given that while some of us have tried to objectively compare the two colleges, we all have our biases. However, any commonalities you find among people who favor one school over the other are telling. For example, when I read the comments from current or incoming Carleton parents, I am detecting certain themes that resonate with me. It’s no coincidence that I too am an incoming Carleton parent. Ask your son which themes resonate with him. That may help decide fit since you don’t have the luxury of visiting both schools again.  ```\\n',\n",

Honestly and politely  I am not sure how much more needs to be said.  2.2 million students per year in US plus thousands of international student apply to us schools each year.  If there are 40k spots in the top 25 for the US portion of the pool  that’s means only the top 18 percent get in. And now take out legacies athletes and urm it’s even a smaller pool. USC is in that pool. The other big names definitely rank higher and have higher prestige among the people in the pool with them. But very few people care but the other people in the pool with you. USC is 70k per year times four years. They are giving you a free house. He has earned the great reward. Enjoy it.  ```\\n',\n",

Houston is a major city; it’s the fourth largest city in the United States (right after Chicago, actually!) and health, medicine, and biomedical research are  big drivers of Houston’s economy. I’d say your opportunities are roughly equal, at least in any sense that would matter to an undergrad. Rice does a lot of research and is located right next to the Texas Medical Center - but there are lots of other industries in case you change your mind. I’ve only been briefly in both cities but it’s been my experience that moving around Chicago without a car is far easier than getting around Houston without one. If you want something closer to the stereotypical “traditional” college experience - parties, big sports games, school spirit in spades - Northwestern is probably more likely to provide that, at least superficially. But in actuality, the “college experience” varies a lot from school to school and even from person to person. There are definitely people at Big 10 schools who haven’t attended a single sports game and don’t care a whit about sports. And college students everywhere like to party and make good friends, so you can find that at Rice, if you want!  ```\\n',\n",

The brightest and best kids are at Berkeley. My daughter (graduating senior) used to always say one of the best parts of being at Berkeley were the students because they challenge each other to raise their game. She says everyone deserves to be there because they are all brilliant.” You can’t compare a giant state school to an elite private university. The best students at Berkeley are on par with the best students anywhere but there is much more variability at the bottom of the class. This is the price state schools pay for ensuring access to a great education. Berkeley’s mission is very different from Duke’s mission. Also, Duke has almost twice as many Rhodes scholars as Berkeley (despite being a fraction of the size). Not bad for a “party school”. http://www.rhodesscholar.org/assets/uploads/2018%20RS_Number%20of%20Winners%20by%20Institution.pdf  ```\\n',\n",

Presumably this is desired because of law school intentions? “Research assistant” commonly means a PhD student being paid a stipend and tuition waiver for some research assistant work.

I will say one thing - thjnk about how your son will get to campus. You haven’t said what State you DO live in, but VT isn’t that easy to get to. My son is twice as far and it’s cheaper and easier to get him home from Miami. For DD, we have so far tried a plane, train, bus, and ride share. For us the bus to Allentown PA makes sense, but I still have to drive 1-1/2 hours each way to get her .  ```\\n',\n",

Looking at the Math sequence clearly shows that.  The Single Variable Calc sequence is 3 courses as well as the MV/LA sequence whereas at Semester schools they are 2 Semester courses.  The Quarter system does give you the opportunity to take more classes you just don’t go into as much depth in any single course as you would with a Semester class.  Also if you’re taking a requirement you don’t like at least it’s only for 10 weeks. I’m not arguing that Princeton is overall more rigorous than Stanford just that Stanford has a lower floor and that for the student seeking that they can find it easier at Stanford than at Princeton.  ```\\n',\n",

Ultimately, my best advise is to go with your own “gut” feelings. When my son was making his list of schools to apply to, we had a specific strategy with which then we prioritized based on my son’s desired factors. The first and foremost was the institution’s overall undergraduate quality and experience. While we don’t take any college rankings seriously, it’s really no surprise that Princeton comes in as a perennial #1 at each new publication of the USNWR. Princeton’s students-to-teacher ratio of 5:1 is the best there is. Coupled that with their Preceptorial Method, which is a modified version of the Oxford tutorial, what you have is an outstanding undergraduate learning experience. By intention, Princeton has set their institutional focus on undergraduate more than graduate students. Their undergraduate population is only 5,232 while the graduate population is 2,747. Stanford, on the other hand, has about 2,000 more undergraduate population than Princeton and about 11,000 graduate population. Again, by institutional design, Princeton doesn’t have Law, Medical and Business schools. Princeton’s endowment per student is also perennially ranked #1 with $2.7M endowment per student, while Stanford is ranked #5 with $1.5M. And Princeton’s alumni giving, an important signifier of undergrad student satisfaction, is also perennially at #1. Since you mentioned it, HYP has that elite “Ivy League” prestige while Stanford has its own “Stanford prestige.” While Stanford prestige might still grow and no matter how much it could possibly gain with time, it still isn’t the same as the HYP’s Ivy League mystique. And it’s not like HYP and other Ivy League are at stand still while Stanford forges ahead leaps and bounds with prestige-building. It’s not that my son and I don’t like Stanford. When we made a priority list of colleges to apply to, Stanford was 4th on our list after HYP, and that was strictly based on our assessment of undergrad qualities and experiences. My son loves Princeton as the right place to get his undergrad degree while he’s aiming at Stanford as one of top few grad schools to apply to. As an undergraduate-focused institution, my son would rather bet on the institution with 2,000 less undergrad students. Less chance to get lost in the shuffle. But these remarks are my and my son’s take. Everyone’s needs are different. Ultimately, as I stated at the very beginning, go with your own gut feelings after exhaustively investigating on undergrad quality comparisons. Good luck with your decision making. Either way, you’ll be in a great place.  ```\\n',\n",

It can really affect how well they do even at the high school level.  I combat that all the time with students who were slower to develop math skills thinking they must be “dumb” and not even trying.  I see it as an end result with adults who go back for a degree later in life terrified of math, take Alg, and wonder “why couldn’t I get that in high school?” For med school only GPA matters (not rigor) for academics, so if a student thinks they can do well, they usually do. There is a difference that my lad has seen once in med school.  His undergrad classes (U Roc) seem to have prepared him very well for the coursework.  He tells us many of his peers in med school are envious asking him how he already knows X.  “I learned it in undergrad.”  Whether that came from his college, major, or specific classes/profs that differed is impossible to tell, esp with anecdotal data.  In any case, in med school they teach you everything you need to know, so if one doesn’t have a head start, they just have to put a little more time into learning it then.  That’s similar to some folks getting material in undergrad in a 201 or 301 course instead of 101.  (I’ve seen this happen via tests - what’s covered in a higher level research school’s 101 course for “everyone” can be in a later course for majors at a different school.) When kids from my school are hoping to go to med school and ask for my advice it’s simple.  Look for an affordable school you like where you’re in the Top 25% of entering stats, read U Roc’s School of Medicine Class Profile for a few years (changing the URL to get more years), then work to become a student they like on your application.  This makes the assumption that U Roc’s SOM is similar to others in what they look for in applicants, but I highly suspect they are. https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/MediaLibraries/URMCMedia/education/md/documents/2022-profile.pdf  ```\\n',\n",

I thought Pomona only gave students a week to commit or move on. Just listen to your heart, honestly. As cliche as that is, you’re the only one who knows what you want out of your college experience and I’m sure you’ve confronted certain thoughts and feelings over the past few days. It seems like you’ve gotten a lot of perspective from people (I saw topics on other websites as well), though I will say a lot of it is JHU focused simply by nature of them being a much larger school. I could see a lot of misconceptions regarding Pomona with the perspectives detailed (including the one above), but at this point I don’t really find it worthwhile to “dispute” points raised. If anything, they can give you a sense for what colleagues and friends might perceive a degree from a top LAC to mean, whether or not that’s grounded in anything true. If the opinions of others is something which especially matters to you, and you want to impress others with your institution, then there is the appeal of Johns Hopkins which is widely renowned as a leading university. I will be honest with you that Pomona will not give you much in the way of immediate glamour, and not everyone can tolerate that. But as a recent graduate, I know I was able to have the best undergraduate experience there and can stand on my own accomplishments and perspectives rather than the public worth of my institution alone. No point in overthinking this. Small LAC with the individual attention and undergrad-centered experiences, or big university with world-class professors and research? They are vastly different. Enough has been elaborated at this point regarding the pros and cons of either. One will clearly resonate with you more than the other. Good luck with your choice, and once you’ve made it, move on to imagining the excitement and possibility you’ll have as an incoming first year at either!  ```\\n',\n",

Your interest and affinity for STEM subjects puts you miles ahead of the average liberal arts and science graduate. Be careful taking various “return on investment” (ROI) calculi too literally. Hamilton may have the highest. BUT, Wesleyan also has among the highest percentage of seniors going into the visual and performing arts within NESCAC (10.6%) - notoriously risky careers - right after graduation while Hamilton has among the lowest (4.5%) So, obviously, that’s going to make a difference. Can you code? You can refine your computing skills at just about any of the top LACs; they are amply represented at places like Google.  ```\\n',\n",

He thought ND was a special place and kids really smart but a bit homogeneous.  He has loved uva and will be honored by living on the Lawn for senior year. As I said brother in law who is successful attorney loved ND and it’s network has served him well.

I believe the answer is maybe in very few scenarios such as for investment banking and consulting and by firms such as Goldman Sachs and McKinsey which target a few schools for recruiting. A nd maybe one can argue that Stanford’s proximity to Silicon Valley’s ecosystem would confer some advantage for graduates interested in tech start-ups. Yes, high tech firms recruit all over the country, but the informal ways to connect with venture capitalists, founders, etc. is undeniably richer in Silicon Valley. Also, in some rare situations where the employer is a foreign country-backed (particularly China) organization looking for employees with internationally prestigious education credentials, Harvard and Stanford would offer an advantage by virtue of their reputation internationally. These are all very rare situations. For the majority of career fields, no there would not be meaningful difference.  ```\\n',\n",

I would say that Washu artsci does follow a “liberal arts” curriculum meaning that they place a heavy emphasis on well-roundedness being STEM or the humanities. I have a few friends doing polisci and are interning at various congressional offices so if you’re looking to go into politics Washu is a great place for that. If your plan after undergrad is to go into grad school, Washu is also very good as Washu has really great name recognition in academia and I have heard good things about grad school placements from all majors. Feel free to dm me with any further questions. If I can’t answer them, I can try to ask some friends.  ```\\n',\n",

His thesis is in boundary layer fluid mechanics. He took more math as an undergrad at Cal Poly than is required in a the aerospace focus of ME at Caltech. Their main distinguishing factor is not level, but pace. They go at a speed higher than any other institution probably in the world. It is debatable though whether or not that produces a better undergraduate product. As I said, engineering is very egalitarian. Much like music, you have the chops or you don’t. How you get than can be extremely variable.  ```\\n',\n",

Doesn’t matter what any ranking says, this is a deteriorating situation. Alexandre, do you deny this?\"\" CU123, many state universities are hurting, just as many private universities are hurting. But we are not discussing public universities on this thread. This thread is about Michigan. Michigan is not hurting. Financially, Michigan is doing very well. The University’s endowment has at the fastest pace of any university in the nation between 1990 and today. In 1989, Michigan’s endowment was not even among the top 30 in the nation. Today, it is the 8th largest. In 2009, in the midst of the financial meltdown, Michigan spent $100 million to buy Pfizer’s global research HQ campus, made up of some 25 buildings and over 2 million square feet of lab space. Naturally, all universities save HYPS can use more money, and Michigan is no exception, but Michigan is very well off…as well off as Columbia. To address your question, yes, I deny this. According to its CDS, Michigan’s student body in programs that enroll both undergraduate and graduate students has indeed increased from 33,481 in 2007 to 38,076 in 2016. But the size of its instructional faculty in programs that enroll both undergraduate and graduate students has also increased from 2,063 in 2007 to 2,583 in 2016. The student to faculty ratio has remained steady at 15:1. So yes, I deny it, and I have the facts to prove it. http://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2007-2008_umaa.pdf  (Section I2) http://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2016-2017_umaa.pdf (Section I2) But tell me again, how do you justify Columbia’s shameless claim that it has a 6:1 student to faculty ratio when it omits 6,500 graduate students from its calculation? Oh, that’s right, Columbia does not publish a CDS report. In fact, it is the only Ivy League institution that doesn’t. But one thing is clear, Columbia is omitting 6,500 graduate students from its student to faculty ratio and that puts into serious question its ethical practices, as well a the integrity of the data it publishes. Columbia’s actual student to faculty ratio would likely double if it were being honest, and its ratio would be 12:1 rather than 6:1. But that would mean a drop in the rankings, so obviously, Columbia and its private peers have little incentive to be honest. And what of the very flawed rankings methodology? Do you deny that private universities are gaming the rankings and that the methodology is seriously flawed?  ```\\n',\n",

I’m also a part of those exact same chats and groups, and if you look at the roommate spreadsheet (which is still a fraction of the incoming students) you’ll see a lot more variety in partying preference. Wherever you go people will be into different things, but WashU actually has a great student culture where you’re not pressured or expected to do things you don’t want to do. I and the girls I’ve talked with so far are more into pizza and movies (but to each her own, of course). And no matter how much people want to party, we’re all going to get our butts kicked by hard (but engaging and cool!) classes and have to study a lot. Like @Hamurtle said, WashU is super collaborative, and GroupMes don’t provide the whole picture  Best of luck with your decisions!  ```\\n',\n",

The Admissions Office isn’t judging you anymore. Admitted students are part of the Penn family. Now Penn needs to ensure that you are supported and successful. You have what it takes to succeed, or they would not have admitted you, and Penn has the classes, support, resources, and opportunities to make this a life-changing four years for you. The critical thing is to connect early with people who can guide you to access and take full advantage of those resources and begin that process early. As you begin to do that, realize that at Penn rigorous academics is only a piece of the puzzle. Getting involved in extracurricular activities like research, internships, clubs, travel abroad, etc. are a big part of the experience. Developing a social network is also important. Social connections often begin with pre-orientation activities, which you should participate in, your dorm, and the clubs you join. It is helpful to make an effort to make friends early because everyone is trying to make friends at that point. It will be challenging, but you will be a big success!  ```\\n',\n",

You will be surprised at the response. JHU does have more lay and professional name recognition than Pomona at the professional level which will help if you do not choose to go to grad school.  It also helps that all of the FANG companies recruit on campus for JHU - not sure if the same is true for Pomona (doubtful).  JHU’s comp sci major is also world renowned (especially for cyber security) and small which helps tremendously.  It doesn’t help that Pomona’s CS program is not even ABET accredited let alone recognized. To say JHU’s reputation is primarily medical is a bit shortsighted.  JHU is well known in silicon valley - far more from my subjective experience versus any LAC given none of them having an engineering school save for Mudd (which is also a relative unknown).  It helps that JHU’s ex-president is heavily involved in the community and Stanford (Will Brody).  And it doesn’t hurt that IBM’s ex ceo and chairman of the board (Samuel J. Palmisano) is a JHU alum. Contrary to @nostalgicwisdom  Go to US News and compare JHU to Pomona: Alumni giving rank: #6 amongst all universities (37.5%) vs Pomona (27.6%) 54th amongst all LACs. Academic Reputation: JHU (4.6) Top 5 amongst all universities versus 4.4 for Pomona - top 20 amongst LACs. Disclaimer:  Former JHU undergrad alum and MIT grad alum working at Google now in Mountain View.  I would choose JHU in a heartbeat and it also helps they wanted you first.  If you tell people in the valley you majored at Comp Sci at Pomona, a non-insignificant amount would have assumed you went to Calpoly Pomona since the latter actually has an engineering school.  No need to make that distinction with Hopkins. As for the network, yes it exists.  I and several other JHU grads have referred fellow JHU alums to Google.  We have an SF JHU young alumni chapter that takes care of other alums for tech jobs too. Pomona isn’t even the top ranked LAC in US News and it does not compare to Hopkins from a CS level.  ```\\n',\n",

The difference is driven primarily by liberal arts and pure sciences  admits who  would choose Yale much more, but Yale loses a big chunk of the engineering and business admits to Penn. It is precisely because it has an edge in these preprofessional areas than Penn is able to attract more cross-admits.  By comparison the split between Harvard vs Penn and Stanford vs Penn is 77% vs 23% and 72% vs 28% and is statistically significant. And this is because it cannot attract as many of these admits from Stanford and Harvard. We are talking about engineering in general, op is not exactly set on bioengineering. but even for bioengineering, while the difference is not huge,  Penn is still  ranked higher and in combination with its stronger medical school and hospital and higher research funding in this field, it can be argued that it has an good edge.  ```\\n',\n",

What is your background, @Happytimes2001? @Alexandre attended both UMich and Cornell and stated that he did not see a difference in resources between the two.  Are you thus asserting that the resources at MIT are far and away beyond what is available at Cornell? And what resources are you referring to? BTW, when it comes to startup founders, from a Crunchbase spreadsheet I analyzed, yes, MIT and Stanford outpace UMich (though UMich isn’t too shabby, being in the top 10: https://news.crunchbase.com/news/top-schools-among-founders-raise-big-dollars/), but here’s the thing: roughly half or more of those MIT/Stanford alums who were startup founders were grad alums (including PhD’s and MBA’s).  And PhD’s are fully fulled while 2 years of a Master’s/MBA is significantly cheaper than 4 years of undergrad at MIT at full-pay, which is why I said that if the OP excels as much in undergrad as he has in HS, he will still be able to get the opportunities afforded MIT/Stanford alums.  ```\\n',\n",

And when comes to the splitting of hairs over Wall Street.  How about Warren Buffett he’s pretty well respected. University of Nebraska and here’s what he has to say on the matter. “When Warren Buffett is looking at hiring a new employee or finding a new company to invest in, he has a lot of criteria. But, one thing he isn’t looking for are fancy university degrees. “I don’t care where someone went to school, and that never caused me to hire anyone or buy a business,” Buffett says “ Go where you like and do the best you can!

Binge drinking is a pervasive problem at many schools. Some schools have banned hard alcohol on campus as a result of these findings, i.e., Dartmouth. Regarding Kenyon (or any school) the best source (but not perfect) for campus drinking, drug, and rape statistics is the Clery report. All schools have to report these numbers annually. In Kenyon’s case when you calculate average drinking and drug infraction incidence (taking into account size of student body) over last 3 years, Kenyon’s incidence is high relative to many schools of similar size like Hamilton, Bowdoin and Williams. Again, these stats are not perfect and can reflect school by school reporting differences, or even how actively campus police/RAs, etc,  are looking for drugs/alcohol, but it is decent data nonetheless.  ```\\n',\n",

Stanford freaking caters to Olympians and pro athletes.  I can’t imagine any true athlete picking Princeton over Stanford purely for the athletic advantage.

As new fields develop, they split off from the more established departments. Physics gave birth to EE, and EE had to fight for it.  ME is responsible for a lot of the development in BM, but so are ChE, EE and the life sciences. As these field continue to develop, the interdisciplinary nature of BME becomes more complex and apparent. Sometimes the parents don’t like to see the children leave home. They don’t like the loss of control of their offspring and they don’t like the competition for resources within the institution. This result is the fruit of academic politics, but programs do differ. This is another step in the ongoing evolution of engineering/science. Learn about the siblings.  I believe JHU covers the interdisciplinary range of BME.  I am not sure here, but I believe GT is more into the robotics side of BME.  Check with GT.  ```\\n',\n",

Also how are you so sure that Hopkins does not engage in student profile refinement as you call it? Every schools does that, but still this can only go so far. You cannot predict what choices an RD applicant will have and you cannot predict which applicants will for sure choose your school of admitted. Chicago’s yield has increased because it has managed to maintain a top 10 USNews spot for quite some time now, it is generally high ranked, and has revamped its undergrad to attract a wider audience. Still Chicago is a more niche place relative to the ivies so it tends to be a bit more self-selected.  RD yield is not at all as easily manipulated as you make it to be. Why is Parchment garbage? It is not 100% accurate but they jut track revealed preference. there are no 100% accurate verifiable sources for these sort of things anyway. The difference is RD yield between Hopkins and Cornell/Brown, the other Ivies is not due to the fact that these schools have some amazing yield protection techniques that somehow Hopkins doesn’t use.  ```\\n',\n",

That is why it is not interested in playing the rankings game.  The rankings game is all about attracting a lot of applicants who - deep down – are more concerned with prestige than anything else. U. of Chicago was one of the most intellectual colleges back when it had 30% and higher admissions rates.  Students didn’t apply there because of prestige – they applied there because they wanted that kind of education. Chasing prestige is fine and understandable.  But it isn’t something that intellectual colleges care about.  ```\\n',\n",

VaT is the prettiest campus, with the Hokie Stone buildings and mountain back drop.  NCSU Centennial Campus is very nice too and is where most of your engineering classes will be.  Be sure to check out the Hunt Library when you visit.  PSU campus is huge and very traditional (in a good way).  I went to a white-out game!  Had a great time. Raleigh/Triangle will have more opportunity and more things to do in the area. Visit and see which one feels the best.  ```\\n',\n",

I’ll add that to say Middlebury has the most serious outdoor kids of the three schools makes little sense based on my observations.  I know that my son chose Bowdoin, in part, because of it’s tremendous Outing Club and the school’s emphasis on exploring nature.  It transformed his life.  Today he teaches, and lives, the outdoor adventure world (along with his day job of teaching biology) as do many of his Bowdoin friends now scattered about the planet combining education with the outdoors.  I’ve no doubt Middlebury is similar, and have less connection with Bates.  You’re correct in suggesting that Bowdoin is unique in it’s balance for those who may not be interested in the outdoors…It’s a school set in beautiful Brunswick and attracts a wide range of students from all cultures.  ```\\n',\n",

We have the same choices but admitted students day(s) pushed it clearly to Boston College. Facilities. The vibe of the kids and smiles. Commitment to core and core renewal was excellent. My D is a premed and total STEM focus. Having a commitment to liberal arts for all as part of the educational process is important to her.  No wrong choices here for you.  USNWR has Gtown at 20 and BC 30.  Forbes and elsewhere are similar. BCs business school is even better. PreMed counseling center is better at BC in our opinion as well. Know folks who went through both. Follow your heart and your head will be fine  ```\\n',\n",

If you check professional job listings, you’ll see that there is no distinction between schools, in fact the bachelors is just a minimum requirement.  Experience is where the money and career grows.  If you go for the scholarship at Michigan, you could still use part of that money for a master’s degree, which would squash an MIT bachelors any day of the week.  ```\\n',\n",

If you were 100% set on Engineering, I would say that GA Tech is worth the extra money. Since you are not, it is not. Another way to make money is in Business/Finance, and I’m sure both Hamilton and Wesleyan, as prestigious as they are in the northeast, have inroads to jobs in those fields.

If you want to raise venture capital for your business idea in 10 years, you will want MIT. Ask someone in the field you plan to go into. Opportunities (networking, capital and other cannot be discounted) Are they worth 250K, that depends. But every MIT student can get into other schools on a free ride. Yet, they chose MIT.

It is located not too far from the busy Interstate 95 highway corridor. UR’s campus is in the sprawling suburbs of Richmond, about 10 mins. from downtown areas, including the very fun Carytown area, which is popular with students. There is lots of shopping, grocery stores, good access to medical care, etc. in the surrounding areas. Richmond and its suburbs are certainly smaller and less populous than Philly and its suburbs, but hardly rural. Areas west of Richmond, heading towards the mountains in Shenandoah and the Charlottesville area where UVA is located are much more rural. That area is lovely with lots of farms, vineyards, parks and hiking, scenic views. Richmond has 2 Amtrak rail stops, 1 downtown and 1 in the suburbs, which many UR students use. Richmond also has an international airport, although not gigantic, and the campus has shuttles available to accommodate student travel for breaks. UR runs also shuttle buses to several shopping areas as well as to downtown Richmond. Students also use Uber ride sharing to get around, and many students have cars on campus, since parking is plentiful and inexpensive (although a car is not necessary, neither of my UR grads had one).  ```\\n',\n",

In all honesty I’m a mix of a lot of things and because of that I fear that it would be hard for me to really fit in any group because I’m not predominantly any ‘type.’ [/quote]  You sound perfectly normal and well rounded and I think you’ll find your tribe at either school.  I actually think at smaller schools, like Bates & Hamilton, there can be less cliques because you end up knowing a greater % of the student body and can move more fluidly through and with groups. You’ll walk into the cafeteria or library and even if you don’t immediately know people, you will recognize people and invariably they will nod and smile vs being closed off into some kind of do not enter group.  At least that is how my D who is at a different LAC says it works! You mention the prep factor at Hamilton.  When I toured with my D, she wasn’t feeling the prep, but that could have been because our tour guide was a bit boho/intellectual.  But she knows multiple kids at both schools, who would be considered kind of like urban/prep, but again that’s a small sample size and there will be outdoorsy and artsy kids at both schools as well.  ```\\n',\n",

Before you choose Harvard, run some financial calculators so you can see for yourself what the real cost is of those loans.  You’ll wind up paying over $150K for that 80K loan if you take 20 years to pay it off.  That’s hundreds of dollars a month that will NOT go to a mortgage, or to investments, or in your own future kid’s college fund.  Don’t do it.  ```\\n',\n",

I don’t know the actual numbers (OP could look them up if they care) but if 40% of Stern graduates get an MBA while only 20% of Wharton students do, then there’s a 20% chance that Wharton further saves you around $400k all else equal. I agree with the above posts though, Stern is the safer path. For certain individuals and certain circumstances it would make more sense to attend Wharton given the edge in placement, MBA necessity, and preference for campus/culture, but it’s dependent on the individual and is a riskier path to take.

Both Princeton and Stanford are beautiful campuses. And you have a tough decision. Stanford’s sports program is always #1. Stanford football is a perennial Top 10-20 team. The Stanford men’s soccer team is the 2-tIme defending national champion. The Stanford women’s soccer team is currently #1 in the country and a perennial College Cup (Final 4) participant. The women’s volleyball team won the championship last year. Swimming, tennis, blah, blah, blah, you get the point. About 15-20% of the campus are recruited athletes at Stanford. I do want to say that there are more than few cold (32 degrees ish) mornings here in the winter, so hopefully, Stanford will let you use the indoor ERG’s instead of hitting the Bay.  :))  ```\\n',\n",

A lot of assumptions. GA Tech knows that you’re an elite admit.  This is why they are offering a full ride, plus a stipend (they are paying you to attend!), plus money for research and internet travel, plus several other perks.  What is Harvard’s pitch? Nothing, aside from admission.  Harvard will not sweeten the deal (there is no deal; you’ve been admitted; that’s it).  Harvard will not work to compete with other offers.  Harvard doesn’t have to.  It’s Harvard. But what does that mean?  Listen, I am not anti-Ivy.  I admire the students who have worked so hard to gain admission to the Ivies, Stanford, Duke and so on.  But I also admire those who take a pass, knowing that there’s a better offer on the table.  You’ll also be known on the GA Tech campus, and for the rest of your life actually, as the guy who got into Harvard but told them to take a hike.  There’s something admirable about that. You’re in a position that is common.  You got into your dream school, but your family cannot afford it.  I don’t know if this is because your family’s EFC at Harvard is too high or because your parents are not willing to pay it.  Either way, Harvard is unaffordable.  GA Tech is not.  Full rides should not be treated lightly, and I know that you are not doing so.  In fact, I got a strong sense that you know that GA Tech is the smart move.  It’s the brand name and prestige of Harvard that is beckoning. Google the story of the young man who was admitted to all eight Ivies, plus Stanford, Duke, and so on.  He turned them all down to accept an offer just like yours to attend the U. of Alabama.  Why?  The same situation as you.  He wants to become a doctor and felt, with the cost of medical school ahead, he would be best served (and save his family money) to take the full ride. I wish you best with whatever choice you make.  ```\\n',\n",

But I have no idea where your stats are comming from regarding BC Carroll School of Management low pay and localized around Boston?  That’s utter nonsense. Sorry. A large group of students stay in Boston because Boston is very attractive and New England despite the weather gets a hold of you. So yeah BC is big in Boston. Which also the educational capital of the world. The mutual fund capital, genetics reasesrch and pharmaceutical. And hot tech.  And low pay. I could give you the list of superstar CSOM grads but that would be unnecessary. Congrats on all the great options  Best of luck at UNC and enjoy the great hoops too!  ```\\n',\n",

The state share of costs per student dropped from $14,690 in 1996 to $7,160 in 2017, according to UC data. The university has made up some of the difference by hiking tuition and increasing the number of out-of-state students, who pay more, but both efforts have sparked opposition.” http://www.dailycal.org/2015/11/23/to-fund-enrollment-boost-uc-will-phase-out-out-of-state-financial-aid/ Along with the elimination of financial aid for incoming out-of-state students, the university is increasing nonresident tuition by 8 percent in the next year and projecting to enroll an additional 1,200 nonresident undergraduates. Out-of-state students make up a significant portion of students on the university’s flagship campus — roughly 35 percent of UC Berkeley’s incoming students were nonresidents in 2014. Abril raised concerns about the effects of cutting out-of-state financial aid on campus diversity. “You’ll be creating a pipeline for that percentage of students to be entirely socioeconomically homogeneous,” he said. “You’ll lose most of the students who would ever consider coming here who are low income and out of state.” http://www.dailycal.org/2018/02/02/cautious-optimism-campus-budget-update-reveals-progress-deficit-dearth-state-funding/  ```\\n',\n",

The Stamps Scholarship is a highly coveted award, speaks volumes in and of itself, and creates an entire additional network. https://www.stampsfoundation.org/2018/02/08/introducing-stamps-scholars-connect/ FWIW, there are plenty of young people out there who are quite successful without having attended HYPMS. They may even work or attend grad school right alongside MIT grads with their lowly state school degree (of which UM does not even qualify since it is a powerhouse U.)  MIT grads aren’t like people on TV commercials walking around with a golden glow bc of their UG degree.     And the MIT degree does not guarantee automatic business success or grad school admissions.  The person behind the degree matters, and a student who qualified as a Stamps Scholar has demonstrated significant accomplishments already. As a high school student, your perspective is limited to what you hear from others that you believe. I hope the OP of this thread is in dialogue with his parents, not his peers, and that they ignore everything except what is best for their personal situation. This young person faces a win-win decision. There is no bad answer (unless the $250,000 does financially hurt his parents.)  ```\\n',\n",

Btw Dartmouth nd Cornell accept a % of their class ED that is similar to Hopkins. For the class of 2020: Hopkins RD Yield: ~27.5% Dartmouth RD yield: ~37% Cornell RD yield: ~40.9% (Penn RD yield: ~50%+, only since you mentioned Penn manipulating yield - it does but still has a high RD yield) Saying that Hopkins admits more academically accomplished students is just not true. Dartmouth SAT (V+M) middle range (old) class of 2020: (670+680) - (780+780) Cornell SAT (V+M) middle range (old) class of 2020      : (650+680) - (750+780) Comparison to Cornell is not apples to apples since Cornell has some non-tradiditonal program that attract students with lower scores. Even that small difference does not suggest a actual difference in student quality. As for Dartmouth, it has slightly higher stats on paper. Also many top schools do not solely focus on scores and GPA, they dont mind admitting some special students who have created a company or have done something else out of the box but have lower stats.  ```\\n',\n",

Both are excellent schools with lots of clinical and research opportunities convenient to the main undergrad campus. And both are rigorous and respected without being known for cut-throat academics or grade deflation (or inflation, either, for that matter).  But, yes, you’ll also find “weed out” courses at both schools as well. Remember, too, MOST students do not go to undergrad and med school at the same institution.  So, size of med school class or reserved places for REMS is sort of immaterial.  Some of the best schools for pre-meds are LACs that have no direct ties to med school but provide excellent education and good pre-med advising. Conventional advice for pre-meds is to make sure that they pay attention to COA, since they will have several more years of schooling after undergrad to consider in terms of finances.  ```\\n',\n",

Unfortunately Kenyon College had a few highly publicized incidents involving drinking. There were two deaths, I believe. Passed out drunk & froze to death in a nearby cornfield. I think that while almost all colleges have a large segment of students who drink, some schools have a binge drinking culture often attributed to rural location, small size & isolation. I think that the Kenyon administration has addressed the issue in a forceful manner over the past few years. Kenyon College is actively addressing the heavy drinking culture so things may have gotten better over the past few years. Actually some poster or posters complained a year or two ago, that the crackdown by the administration was too harsh.  ```\\n',\n",

[/quote]  Amherst doesn’t have EDII. Just ED and RD. It does have an excellent record with med school placement and very individualized med/health advising. It doesn’t screen applicants for committee letters and supports all of them even if they don’t make what it considers to be “likely admit” MCAT and GPAs. But the question of Canadian vs US med schools is definitely important to look into. If it will be really hard to get into a US Med school as a Canadian citizen, you may be better off applying to Canadian med schools and that might or might not mean applying from a Canadian undergrad. Many students who think they want to be pre-med change their minds, and not necessarily because it’s “too hard”, but because they discover related careers that they didn’t know about that require fewer years of education, pay well and are better fits. I’ll also add that Amherst’s recent study of its athletics program, just completed this year, found that few varsity athletes major in the sciences. As a pre-med you have something like 7 required science courses with labs, so this may be something to look at - can you make time for the work and the required labs and still compete on the team?  Some can and do, but fewer than non-athletes. https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/PlaceOfAthleticsAtAmherst_Secure_1.pdf  ```\\n',\n",

I can only speak about PSU, but supposedly only 1 in 3 who start in engineeeing actually graduate with an engineering degree. It’s pretty brutal but that’s also why a lot of recruiters hire students from there. You could also compare the entrance to major requirements between schools. At PSU no one is technically accepted into their major. Rather they have to take a handful of required courses and hit a certain GPA before officially declaring it.  ```\\n',\n",

Also Cornell is a bit grade-deflated too but nowhere near as bad as Hopkins. Grade inflation/deflation is a important consideration for pre-med student. GPA can literally make you or break you in med school admissions. Personally my first choice would be Dartmouth and second Cornell and I would then apply to Hopkins for med school. All three schools are more or less similarly prestigious, probably Dartmouth and Cornell a bit more for undergrad because of the ivy league tag.  For medical school Hopkins is more prestigious.  ```\\n',\n",

Vassar can be accessible to NYC and the eastern seaboard, which can be a plus for some, while Kenyon is very much a self-contained residential community, which is part of its charm for others. Vassar does not have a history of football or greek life, whereas Kenyon has several teams that are ranked nationally in the top 10 and which hope to win a national championship, including swimming and diving and Men’s soccer, and it has greek life. If you felt a deeper connection to one, after full visits, then go with your heart.  ```\\n',\n",

It also will (at least early on) have gigantic lectures” During a tour I sat in the largest lecture hall at McGill. I did not count the seats, but as far as I could tell it is the same size as the largest lecture hall at MIT, the room where I studied freshman physics.

This will be key. Had you taken calculus before you took statistics? (Reaching the highest possible level in math is crucial for business schools). Smeal is the most selective college at PSU - only about 10% students are pre-admits from high school. The regular path is DUS-&gt; qualifying classes=&gt; admission to Smeal as a junior. Your ECs are impressive and will be useful for the private universities you applied to. ECs matter for Schreyer but dont really matter for general university Admissions. In addition, this year was totally weird due to their adopting BOTH early action AND common app. Pitt is an excellent choice. Is it affordable? If so, you’ve got a great safety.  ```\\n',\n",

Between Kelley and Cox that is more of a best fit question.  The entirety of SMU undergrad is the size of Kelley, so that is more just a question of what she is interested in class sie, whether, etc.  Many of the kids I go to school with were in at ut mccombs, and chose SMU.  They were not plan 2 or mccombs honors though - those are on another level. Great opportunities for sure wherever she may go.  ```\\n',\n",

I too have friends that did pre-med (and are still there) at Hopkins as did my roommate, so I’d think being closer to the vest is more reputed than your third hand assertions. Cornell selectivity is also not quite apples to apples since they have a CALS division. What’s also clear is that Hopkins is enrolling more academically accomplished students (similar to what Northwestern began doing in the past) - while still maintaining yield, which makes the lower yield more impressive than Cornell or Dartmouth.  Hopkins also isn’t just taking high scorers with potential lower rank ala vandy (with 87% ranked in top 10%) SATs of enrolled freshman: Hopkins: SAT (M+V old scale):1420 to 1570 Freshman in top 10%: 94% Cornell: SAT (M+V old scale):1330 to 1520 Freshman in top 10%: 90%  ```\\n',\n",

[/quote]  I don’t think that’s a fair assumption. Cornell and Penn have much better CS reputation in my experience, and Penn benefits from overrepresentation in the financial sector, even within tech. I think calling Michigan a top 5 school for CS is a reach, but I think it’s safely a top 15 CS school. I don’t think you can say the same about Columbia. The 5th in CS reputation is hotly debated on CC - I don’t think going down this road accomplishes anything.  ```\\n',\n",

Of course the Ronald Tutor Center at lunch seems like Times Square in NYC, but once you get off the main paths, you would be surprised by all the lovely fountains and garden areas. I have been there close to 50 times and keep finding new corners of that campus. And the facilities themselves all have wonderful hideaways. The new Marshall//Business building Fertitta Hall is fantastic. The new Village is crazy impressive, so if you get into USC, don’t worry about finding your space there. You have wonderful choices ahead of you. My D didn’t choose UNC CH because with 80% NC students, she feared it would lack the diversity she is use to being in California. Just one perspective of many you can consider.  ```\\n',\n",

Your having to switch jobs isn’t ideal though. Even if jobs are plentiful, the problem isn’t finding  job, it’s finding a good, stable job with good pay and benefits. Is your current job portable? Does your company have branches in the Columbus area? Are you sure you have to move? Could you plan with the college’s health system, set up a plan for her so that she’s checked regularly by a doctor recommended by her hospital or knows what to do?  ```\\n',\n",

I grew up 30 minutes from Ann Arbor, was a 3rd generation Wolverine, and went to Michigan & Ross.  It felt like a different world, honestly.  I spent time with bright (some brilliant) students and profs from all over the country, and in some cases all over the world.  I was immersed in coursework and opportunities that were nothing like my HS life.  Ann Arbor is a great town to live in the middle of.  My parents tried to give me space, never dropped in unannounced.  I saw HS friends sometimes on campus, but wasn’t obligated to spend time with them if I didn’t want to. Once I was out of college, the Michigan name opened doors for me, too.  I am in a business where my resume gets reviewed a lot, and I often get, “Michigan —that’s a good school” comments when they get to that part of my resume. You can move elsewhere after undergrad.  And a Michigan degree makes that easier. I didn’t love everything about my experience there, but that is more that I might have thrived most at a smaller school.  But I would pick Michigan over South Carolina every single time.  It is silly to pay OOS tuition in this case.  Don’t be put off by it being close to home — it is a whole different thing to be a student on campus than to live nearby.  ```\\n',\n",

She had some good choices, like your daughter, and I didn’t think SMU was going to make the top 3.  After final visits to the other choices - and none of them feeling quite right - she made a trip to SMU by herself for an admitted student weekend.  Within the first few hours, she knew she had found her place.  She works hard at her studies (she is an engineering major) but has had the time and opportunity to be involved with a few campus organizations.  Because she has been involved and met lots of different people, she has had a very good experience so far.  Sounds like your daughter has some great options.  Obviously there were more highly ranked options for engineering schools but we weren’t entirely sure she would enjoy engineering and hoped she would choose a school with lots of other options if she decided to change majors.  Rankings are important, I guess, but we didn’t really care all that much.  Factors like travel distance (she’s 1000 miles away but a short, relatively inexpensive direct flight), job / internship opportunities in large city (Dallas), active campus ministry (we are Catholic), affordability with merit scholarships, and a small, supportive engineering program played into her decision more than any ranking.  ```\\n',\n",

The cost difference over 4 years is about $184,000 ($46,000 X 4) plus interest. NYU Stern finance is one of the best undergraduate programs in the world. Lots of internship opportunities. Earn a NYU Stern degree, work for two to three years, then get an MBA from Wharton, Columbia, Northwestern, Chicago, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Dartmouth, UCal-Bezerkley or even from Duke, Virginia, Michigan and you will be much better off than just having an undergraduate degree from Wharton. Or get a one year specialty masters degree in finance, data science, etc. if that is your career goal. Do NOT pay sticker price for Wharton when you have a very substantial discount from NYU Stern. If you pay sticker for Wharton in light of your Stern offer, then you should be dismissed from business school, common sense school & anything related. What would you rather have for essentially the same out-of-pocket dollars (unless you get an MBA scholarship which are readily available for female MBA candidates):   A very expensive University of Pennsylvania Wharton undergraduate degree or   An affordable NYU Stern undergraduate degree from one of the best finance schools in the world & a prestigious MBA from a top school based on your career goals after working for 2 or 3 years post undergraduate school ?    ```\\n',\n",

I thought I saw 20k for regional but not sure [/quote]  Assuming living on campus, mechanical engineering major, PSU Erie is $37,860 for out-of-state, while PSU Main is $48,268.  See https://cce.ais.psu.edu/tuition-calculator-ui/#!/ . Yes, you can complete a bachelor’s degree in EE, IE, or ME at PSU Erie, according to http://main.abet.org/aps/AccreditedProgramsDetails.aspx?OrganizationID=55&ProgramIDs= .  However, the price is rather expensive if the intention is to transfer to PSU Main, using PSU Erie like a community college.  ```\\n',\n",

I totally get why California students want to go there (cheap and high ranked and close to home) and they live with the cons - huge classes, impacted majors, geographically homogeneous student body, etc because it’s highly ranked and cheap. At least at CMU, you are paying for a private school experience. Smaller classes, plenty of sections, geographically diversity, etc.  ```\\n',\n",

During the first quarter, there were no shortage of conversations that, while perhaps not at the level of Plato’s Dialogues, certainly concerned themselves with Plato’s Dialogues. Discussions spilled out of the classroom and into the dining hall and later into the lounge. They’ve since moved well past Plato and Aristotle and more recent discussions are about Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Marx and W. E. B. Du Bois. There are no right or wrong answers to the choice between taking a full-tuition scholarship at USC versus being full pay at Stanford, and it is completely dependent upon a variety of other factors involving all aspects of fit – academic, social, intellectual, and economic.  ```\\n',\n",

All the advices above are really good. With the med school admissions move to competency based admissions, more weight are going to be put on activities outside classroom. If the student is “on the bubble” academically, less time for that student can be put on activities outside classroom. Not to mention the possible anxiety which might come with that uncertainty. Personally I think “just build confidence as a freshman by taking it easy” is a huge mistake. Students should take a mix of difficult and not-so-difficult courses to test the water. Sooner or later those “difficult” courses are going to come. It is better to know if it is feasible to achieve the above-the-threshold GPA as soon as possible. “On the bubble” is the worst scenario.  Adding a more difficult major like computer science/etc.as a backup probably makes things worse. If the student can’t even handle the premed courses without other hard/time-consuming courses, what are the chances that the students would be able to handle both? Plus different majors have totally different internships. There is no one-size-fit-all answer to OP’s question. OP is smart enough to think about this. I agree with @Creekland 's statement 100% “When kids from my school are hoping to go to med school and ask for my advice it’s simple. Look for an affordable school you like where you’re in the Top 25% of entering stats”. It is not good to play tennis in a league full of people like Novak Djokovic if one can’t play tennis at that level. OP should view the course material as its competitor, not its classmates. Yes, at this level, the material is much more advanced. We have reviewed and written some solutions for Orgo exams recently. It is definitely not easy. A high level of understanding of the material is required to answer the questions correctly. (We actually get 2.5 points since we found out TA graded one question wrong — this is the joke … we gained 2.5 points but we weren’t even there.  ) OP should strive to learn the material at a high level in a school at this level. Otherwise, OP should look for other schools with lower standards.  ```\\n\",\n",

Williams wouldn’t even be ranked and Dartmouth is ranked extremely lowly by ARWU, for instance. A school like IU who’s strengths are in business, music, and dance (and doesn’t even offer engineering) would not do well in that ranking. But how much does a heavily STEM-based research ranking tell you about Kelley undergrad? I used the Forbes subrankings because they have a ranking of “American Leaders”, per capita student awards, and per capita PhDs. I can’t find those alumni achievement rankings elsewhere. Graduation rate mostly tells you how strong (and wealthy) entering students are. Salary is heavily influenced by major (and the mix of majors differs a lot; IU doesn’t have engineering; RPI and GTech offer almost no majors outside of STEM). The elite professional school ranking is from a WSJ Feeder ranking from years back. I’ll try to find it.  ```\\n',\n",

Period,  Even Reed acknowledges that fact.  Putting your head in the sand and saying rankings don’t make any difference is ridiculous.  BTW, Reed does participate is rankings it does like, not that it is hypocritical or anything.  Whether you “like” rankings or not isn’t germane to this discussion, in fact any ranking (or polls for that matter) system to include sports, colleges, etc will always be controversial.  ```\\n',\n",

Lots of weed out classes.  (And possibly a bit too much partying.). Google “PSU engineering entrance to major requirements” for details. Some majors require GPAs as high as 3.2. 2 and #3 - As your email or letter states, you were accepted into the COLLEGE but with an intended major...but not directly into the major.  You are technically in what PSU calls premajor status. To officially declare your major, you will have to successfully complete several courses with a C or better and hit a certain overall GPA, which varies depending on your major.  Civil engineering requires a 2.6 but biomedical, mechanical,  and chemical require a 3.2.  My advice is to go to office hours, sign up for Lion tutors, create peer study groups, etc.  and try to do as many math courses as possible at your community college over the summer and transfer them in. Just make sure you confirm with an adviser that they will be accepted before doing so. 4 - PSU engineeeing is super tough but they are in high demand.  Alumni network is the largest outside of Michigan and so the brand name goes far.  ```\\n',\n",

Students going into CS at a highly selective state flagship or private school known for CS should not be surprised that the popularity of the CS major means large classes.  Even places like Stanford and Harvard (700) and Harvey Mudd (200) have large class sizes for their introductory CS courses.  ```\\n',\n",

I think objectively Stanford has the edge. better athletics, better weather, overall stronger school with more resources available because it has top grad schools (say you wanna do research at the medical school/hospital or the business school, or take a law or business class etc).  Also for practically all majors Stanford is just as good or stronger than Princeton. Most importantly, since you gel much better with the coach and team at Stanford I dont see why you wouldn’t go there. All that said, you cannot go wrong with either choice.  ```\\n',\n",

In the US, it’s not necessarily “easily walkable”, not necessarily “animated at all times”, not necessarily “excellent train/bus system/ public transportation”, however it does mean high rises, parks, lots of restaurants, businesses, etc. Depending on where you’re from, you may want to explore that more explicitely. NYC or Boston are very different from Dallas, Austin, or Bloomington. Each has advantages and disadvantages. Note: ask whether dorms have A/C. Has she been admitted to Honors at any of those?  ```\\n',\n",

Columbus is about an hour away, much of it on back roads, so not a mindless commute. Cleveland is close to 2 hours.

Just so I could impress my boss neighbor or someone at s cocktail party If it were revenue neutral I would pick h or s of course.  But this whole conversation is silly.

I went to Duke, D will be going to Brown, and we both loved Berkeley when we visited for a 2 day program.  Although Duke is located in the South, most of the kids come from the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, California and Florida.  Duke does not feel like a Southern school and even though it’s not located in a major city, there is constantly a lot going on with incredible speakers from all over the world and all sorts of research opportunities.  After taking the college tour, my D’s comment was “mom, there is so much going on there, it feels like they are throwing opportunities at you.”  FWIW, Melinda Gates went to Duke and has donated a lot of money there.  Duke is constantly is reaching out to its Alumni to create internships and all sorts of learning opportunities for its students.  Brown does as well: as a parent of a committed student I was already sent  information requests about whether there was anything I could contribute career-wise, and I know an alum who mentors kids in her industry.   Both Brown and Duke are well represented in Silicon Valley. I think of the social life at Brown and Berkeley being similar.  Both are very collaborative places and the kids are very liberal and accepting.   Duke has more social striation and Greek life can be important.  Berkeley ultimately came off our list because we were concerned about the huge class sizes and ability to get the classes you want.  I also felt that the advising programs at Brown and Duke were better.  If we were in-state for Berkeley, my D would have gone there, but I just couldn’t see paying the out of state price when I think you get less services than you do at the privates. But these were our impressions. Hopefully others can give you theirs too so you can get a better feel about if there’s a consistent theme.   Good luck, and you really can’t go wrong. Once you choose, don’t look back, only look forward.  ```\\n',\n",

I would not consider a 3+2 program as a realistic option. Very few students end up doing them, which requires switching colleges after your junior year. I think the focus should be whether you really want to start out as pre-med or in engineering. GA Tech likely is a GPA killer for med school, especially if you are in engineering. But if you want to be an engineer, GA Tech is amazing. If you start out at Hamilton or Wesleyan and decide not to do pre-med, you could get a masters in engineering (with an extra year or two of school elsewhere), though that is sub-optimal compared to just going to GA Tech. Tough decision. If you can visit all of them, that would probably knock one or two of them out.  ```\\n',\n",

That is directly or indirectly (or both…) responsible for them being ranked #1 for undergrad by USNews. Grads show the love by donating. Stanford is better known (and ranked) internationally due to its grad/PhD-level greatness, but you aren’t getting your MBA (P’ton doesn’t have a B school…), JD or PhD – you’re getting your BA or BS. For that, no university is better than Princeton. If you were interested in Engineering or CS, Stanford has the edge. But Princeton is solid in those things and great at about everything else, and where curriculum is even, Princeton has the edge given the close interaction with your profs. Princeton’s reputational bread is buttered by its undergrads and undergraduate emphasis, and that drives the budgeting and decision-making of the school. The undergrads are #1 there – they have to be, since they comprise nearly 70% of the total student population. Motivation and capacity (largest per-student endowment) equal performance. Regardless of your choice, you’ll be at a great school.  ```\\n',\n",

However many of my colleagues are not from elite colleges, and very few people ask a doctor which undergrad they attended.  Most do care to ask which med school and post grad training.  So if your goal is to go to med school it going to Madison is fine as long as you study hard and get great grades.  Buy mediocre grades will certainly not help.  Once you get into med school, going to Yale as undergrad in the long run is only to build up your own self esteem.  ```\\n',\n",

And it doesn’t surprise me that Harvey Mudd might be one of those special cases. It’s exceptionally rigorous. But Williams, Amherst, CMC, Pomona, Middlebury – these are schools where the large pluralities of the students are varsity athletes, and most chose D3 just so that they could find the right balance between sport and school.

So it really depends on exactly what type of engineer you want to become, as to whether Caltech is a good fit.  Caltech is more of a chemistry, math and physics focused school, but the math will prepare students for a career in fluid mechanics for instance.  Thats the science that describes how an airplane moves through the air , the air being a “fluid”. For an undergrad in BME, the chemistry at Caltech, might be compelling, but I would say JHU, Caltech or GaTech are about the same for BME.   Maybe GaTech a tad better, IF the student wants to design prosthesis, the best artificial heart, etc, because GaTech has such a tight relationship with Emory U Medical and has arguably very good mechanical engineering training. All BMEs are going to get more education. So its also a personal preference, does the student  want hot dry Pasadena, a small town, with great access to Los Angeles, or the big bustling city of Atlanta, with sports, hiking, rock climbing close by, or the sailing and crab cakes  that Baltimore offers, with access to Washington DC?  ```\\n',\n",

My roommate went to tons of parties and still did well enough to get into Columbia med with a 3.7 GPA from Hopkins.  Some of it is intelligence - another is time management.  In no way are students going out of their way to not help one another.  People know Hopkins is tough - but this fosters camaraderie since people have the same common goal.  The acceptance rate to Harvard med is like 3% - do people have much to gain by not helping their fellow man when 2 minds are better than one? I personally was not premed, but I was 1 bio course and 1 orgo course away from being one, and I did fine. The only people that complain and moan about premed at Hopkins are ones that did not go there or had a tough time collaborating (luckily these are in the far minority).  ```\\n',\n",

Kenyon’s plays sell out on Saturday nights, and my daughter has gone to several improv shows. They are standing room only—the students attend these activities! Rocky horror picture show, Harry Potter themed fun, a game of murder mystery held in one of the commons are all activities she has mentioned just in this first semester. Of course many kids go to parties afterward (my daughter usually does one of the two weekend nights) but being an athlete she sometimes turns in early or just hangs out in a friend’s dorm after going to the campus activities. I went to an unranked small catholic college myself, and there were never activities offered on campus like that… or if they were, hardly anyone went. That is the key to look for in my opinion if you have a child who wants to do more than go to parties every weekend. Look to see what the college does offer, AND do the students attend! I tend to think because Kenyon is so rural that administration makes a conscious effort to provide opportunities on the weekends. Schools that have a big city near by often times don’t bother because so many students just leave campus. Another reason that small/rural can contribute to a real sense of community. At least that has been my daughter’s experience so far.  ```\\n',\n",

Or do you mean that you would be paying full tuition and full room board expenses etc? (because if it’s the latter, it’s more than $60k per year) And when you say it would be $100k, do you mean over the course of your entire education at Fordham? Just curious as my younger son plays baseball, did Fordham offer any baseball scholarship money?  And at Alabama do you have an offer or would you be trying to get a walk on spot? Good luck!

That alone accounts for a 3%-4% difference in pay. @Alexandre Your good at making stuff up and presenting it as factual.\"\" I am merely stating a statistical reality. If you look at average starting salaries at Cornell, Michigan, Northwestern or Penn, there is an increase of 3%-4% annually. For example, the average Penn starting salary for the SEAS in 2012 was $69,000, 2013 was $72,000, 2014 was $75,000, in 2015 was $83,000 and in 2016 was $88,000. Since Cornell’s report is for 2017 graduates, while Michigan’s and Penn’s report is for 2016 graduates, the comparison isn’t entirely fair. “Also failing to normalize for size, UMich has 5 times as many engineering students as Penn. that would put Penn at nearly 200 vs 149 for UMich after a simple normalization…” Penn lists 68 CS majors out of the 177 who reported their placement and salaries from the SEAS at Penn, compared to 110 CS majors out of the 406 who reported their placement and salaries from the CoE  at Michigan. So it is nowhere near five times more. Like I said, Michigan’s College of Engineering (roughly 6,500 undergraduate students) is 4 times larger than Penn’s SEAS (close to 1,700 undergraduate students, so not 5 times larger), but when it comes to CS majors, Michigan and Penn have roughly the same numbers. As I stated above, Cornell, Michigan and Northwestern have a more balanced concentration of engineering majors than Penn, which seems to focus disproportionately in CS/CE.  Even if you adjust for size, Michigan places a significantly higher number of graduates as Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft than Penn. “…but I did meet a UMich grad working at the Genious Bar so Apple does hire them.” Hehe! You got it there!  I did go to Genius Bar a couple of times, but I never had the presence of mind to ask the service reps for their resumes!   ```\\n',\n",

They both offer an excellent education. One academic thing you should think about is the differing curricula of the schools: Hamilton with the open curriculum; Bates with the more traditional distribution requirements. Check out lists of majors and courses to see which school carries more things that interest you. Compare study abroad programs if that interests you. See what they are doing research-wise if you think you might like to get involved in research at some point. Other fit variables include their environments/settings – Maine vs. Upstate NY, Lewiston vs. Clinton); social vibe (the two sides of Hamilton, the students at both schools and their party and club scenes, Greek life since you mentioned its importance, etc.); and dorms and food. You do have to eat and sleep there for most of four years. And, obviously, cost is a variable.  ```\\n',\n",

If your parents’ EFC is not zero and they will contribute zero, you need merit aid. With zero family help, anything above 11k is likely too much, which means you’d need a quick turnaround application “just in case”. You said your parents don’t value college (although nowadays it’s a signal all employers expect for non minimum job positions) which means they may well hope that your acceptances turn out too expensive and you can’t go. You should apply to Youngstown State and/or UToledo and/or WCU ASAP (like, today, because March is around the corner and honors program+scholarships will soon be gone).  ```\\n',\n",

When my daughter was first looking at colleges she was turned off if a campus had a heavy Greek presence. She even questioned Kenyon early on when she read that 1/3 of students participate in fraternities/sororities. She ultimately decided it was a non-issue when she heard from several students things like “The frat guys here are poets” LOL. It turned out to be an accurate description and she has gone to several “all campus” parties thrown by the fraternities. Where on earth can you find fraternities that invite the whole campus?   ```\\n',\n",

So why not, here is my take on your questions and issues:   Fees: In general education in Canada is usually much less expensive than in the US. This can differ in specific cases but apparently this is your experience also. Getting more financial aid in the US but having it still cost more is perfectly normal.   Reputation- McGill has a very strong worldwide reputation. Mount Holyoke is a good school.   Masters (MA/MBA) prospects- This probably depends more on your grades that anything else. See 11 below… However, McGill does have a wide range of Master’s and Doctorate programs.   Job Prospects- Depends widely on what you study, how you do, and where you want to work. You mentioned that you have never been to Canada nor to the US. If you are not a US citizen nor permanent resident, then getting a visa to work in the US after graduation is unlikely. If you get a 3 or 4 year degree from McGill, this entitles you to get a 3 year work visa for Canada (but not for the US).   Internship opportunities- Mount Holyoke is sort of in the middle of nowhere, which makes me wonder what would be around (there are a couple of nice small towns nearby, but not much in the way of large businesses). McGill is in the center of a large city, and quite near the business center of the city. I am not sure about visa requirements in either case.   Courses offered- Obviously McGill is very good at a very wide range of subjects. I am not sure about taking classes between faculties there. I have heard that McGill students can also take occasional courses at Concordia (a slightly larger nearby university, the only other English university in Montreal), but I don’t know details.   Adjusting-? I’m an international student who has been struggling with some mental health issues. Too much socializing scares me, but I can definitely strike up a convo/get to know people.   McGill is a large university which tends to treat you as an “adult”, which means that support is minimal and you have to go looking for it. If you are not doing well and you don’t ask for help, they no one is going to come find you. Mount Holyoke is a very different environment but I don’t know as much about this.  Extra Curriculars- ? No sports. Singing, dancing, debating, volunteer work, etc  I am not sure that I understand your comment. McGill has sports, singing, small music events almost every night (for example, students in their excellent music school give concerts), and pretty much anything else that you would want to look for. I recall on our last visit an informal hockey game being played on an outdoor rink on the campus (I am pretty sure that the rink disappears and becomes lawn in the spring). You don’t have to partake in any of it if you don’t want to. I might note that the drinking age in Montreal is 18. Some allege this makes drinking on campus less bothersome, because it brings the drinking students out of their dorms and into the bars, where they are less willing to embarrass themselves and also where they are less annoying to anyone who didn’t walk into the same bar. Drinking age in Massachusetts is 21.   Weather- Montreal winters are fine most of the time, but there will be a few very cold snaps. When you are out of the wind it should be ok. Mount Holyoke will also have “real” winters, but not quite as cold. My wild guess is that there might actually be very slightly more snow in Mount Holyoke, but there will be plenty of snow in either location.   Housing- I would love to stay in an apartment (which I will have to do from McGill 2nd yr) but i don’t know if it takes up too much study time.   There are a lot of apartments very close to McGill, and a lot more one or two or three subway stops away. The McGill students seem to do fine with it. Housing in Montreal is relatively moderate in price. I might add that the crime rate will be very low at either school.  I want to do well academically.  Here is a big difference. McGill will be VERY challenging academically. The top universities in Canada, particularly McGill and Toronto, compared to top universities in the US are easier to get into but once there harder to graduate from. You will need to work very hard there, and put in very long hours. If you are very smart and work very hard then you can learn an enormous amount at McGill from professors who really know their stuff. But, this is important: YOU HAVE TO WANT TO DO IT. It is very hard to get an A at McGill. In comparison, Mount Holyoke will not be as academically challenging. It will still be academically very good but it will be easier to get an A (or all A’s). One question: Which will make it easier to go to graduate school? It is hard to say. If you get straight A’s at McGill, then this will be impressive even to the top graduate schools in the US and elsewhere. However, this will be very difficult (or impossible) to do. For most people, getting A’s at Mount Holyoke will probably be so much easier that they will get into graduate school more easily than they would have at McGill. “I can only read and write french as of now.” You don’t need any French at all to go to McGill. If you learn to speak a little bit (un petit peu) of French this will enhance your experience living in Montreal. “This is probably the weirdest question” This is indeed an Apples versus Watermelons sort of comparison. But I can see why it is not an easy choice to make.  ```\\n',\n",

I never said Penn wins the cross-admit battle against Yale, i simply said that it gets a sizable piece, 50%- 30% is a sizable piece. Also yes a lot of it is Wharton but it is not only Wharton. With Harvard & Stanford it is practically only Wharton and dual degrees, with Yale it is engineering students as well. I never said the choice between the two schools should be based solely on the difference in bioengineering. but i just laid out the fact that Penn has consistently been ranked higher for bioengineering, medical school and its hospitals and tends to get more research funding in the field. But i do agree with you that it is not a substantial difference.  And definitely not a substantial difference to base a choice of college on. If you have noticed i keep emphasizing fit to the OP in every other post, as i think this is the main consideration.  ```\\n',\n",

So, UT austin on a full ride might lead you right to a cheap, but top, texas medical school.  Then your total debt might be minimal.  But that is not the case here unless the plan is to go to a georgia State medical school.  And, even then, I venture, going to harvard would likely result in merit money.  My point overall is that it is way to simplistic, if medical school is in the cards, not to even consider how it will play out with the next, larger, expenditure of 400,000 and the 3% admission rates.  I believe that you are far more likely to get in, and get merit money, coming from Harvard.  In that case, the debt is worth it.  I would say, at a mininum, nobody should simply assume that you can get the same output (cheap medical school), from a different input (GT v.Harvard but should at least look at the cost and stats from each school for medical school.  ```\\n',\n",

But that is not the case here unless the plan is to go to a georgia State medical school.  And, even then, I venture, going to harvard would likely result in merit money.  My point overall is that it is way to simplistic, if medical school is in the cards, not to even consider how it will play out with the next, larger, expenditure of 400,000 and the 3% admission rates.  I believe that you are far more likely to get in, and get merit money, coming from Harvard.  In that case, the debt is worth it.  I would say, at a mininum, nobody should simply assume that you can get the same output (cheap medical school), from a different input (GT v.Harvard but should at least look at the cost and stats from each school for medical school.  ```\\n',\n",

I cannot recall the state that was well known for this. (Not sure, but I thought it was either Iowa or Indiana. I was familiar with this regarding law school admission.)  ```\\n',\n",

Suffice it to say that a STEM major is going to have pretty much the same opportunities and drawbacks at any of the top 100 colleges or universities; grades and standardized tests are how you will  distinguish yourself from the pack - not the college’s pedigree. If you major in Bio or Chem you are probably going to have to go on to graduate school of some sort to make a decent living. Computer Science is still a very hot major and you can find a job as a programmer right out of the box. The same is true for Engineering except that a B.S degree by itself hits a salary wall about six years after graduation (at which point, a lot of Humanities and Social Science majors start catching up) and you will want to pursue at least a Masters. IMO, Physics and Math are still the sweet spot as far as intellectual exploration and practical applications are concerned. Physics and Math majors have been known to land on Wall Street in various capacities.  ```\\n',\n",

The only way to get an engineering degree at Amherst would be through a 5-year program, where you spend years 3 and 5 at Dartmouth. Such programs are commonly offered by liberal arts colleges, but rarely utilized in practice;. Amherst says that only one or two students per class go that route. http://www3.amherst.edu/~waloinaz/engineering.html HMC is great for engineering, but maybe not so good for pre-med. HMC does offer common pre-med majors, like biology and chemistry, although they are less popular than engineering. However, it may be difficult to maintain a high GPA at Mudd, as noted above, especially if you also want to swim competitively:  [quote] Prospective pre-medical students considering Harvey Mudd should realize that the College’s technical requirements are considerably more demanding than in typical pre-med programs [/quote]  https://www.hmc.edu/biology/programs-and-courses/pre-med-preparation/ So while both paths are theoretically possible at both institutions, you should assume that Amherst sends far more students to med school than into engineering, while HMC sends far more students into engineering than to med school. So in practice, these two schools may not be the best choices if you are truly undecided and want to keep both options open. There are few LACs that are good for both pre-med and engineering. Swarthmore would be an obvious pick, or Smith if you are female. If you can swim competitivelly at a low Division I level, then Bucknell or Lafayette. If you want to stick to Division III, then maybe consider small DIII universities, like Tufts or Rochester, as well as LACs.  ```\\n',\n",

Cornell Arts & Sciences and Michigan Ross will be VERY different experiences academically. Ross is very preprofessional. It’s almost like an employee training program with some academics sprinkled in. If you double major with math, which is in LSA, you actually would be doing a dual degree, meaning that you would be graduating with a BBA from Ross and a BA (or BS?) in math. At Cornell Arts & Sciences you’d be taking a more traditional course of study. It also has a lot of distribution requirements.  My recommendation is to make a spread sheet of the exact classes you’d have to take (or requirements you’d have to fulfill) every year at each college. Which looks more interesting? Which one gets you more excited? That will make the decision for you (outside of the financial aspect). Of course you can always go to Michigan and major in math there. You can minor in business at Ross if you want. There will be plenty of Wall St. opportunities with an undergrad math major.  ```\\n',\n",

The basic level of subjects that are normally taught over 2 semesters will be taught over 3 quarters at schools with a quarter system.  Of course Stanford has different levels of Math just like Princeton, Yale, and probably all major universities.

Suffice it to say that a STEM major is going to have pretty much the same opportunities and drawbacks at any of the top 100 colleges or universities; grades and standardized tests are how you will  distinguish yourself from the pack - not the college’s pedigree. If you major in Bio or Chem you are probably going to have to go on to graduate school of some sort to make a decent living. Computer Science is still a very hot major and you can find a job as a programmer right out of the box. The same is true for Engineering except that a B.S degree by itself hits a salary wall about six years after graduation (at which point, a lot of Humanities and Social Science majors start catching up) and you will want to pursue at least a Masters. IMO, Physics and Math are still the sweet spot as far as intellectual exploration and practical applications are concerned. Physics and Math majors have been known to land on Wall Street in various capacities.  ```\\n',\n",

Also, some years ago, Rochester established a forward-looking policy where they offer a fifth year tuition-free if a student has earned a degree in a focused major (such as engineering) in four years, and wants a chance to broaden his or her education with the electives that couldn’t fit into the schedule. However, their school ranking took a hit by organizations that look at the percentage of students who graduate in four years. I don’t know if that’s still the case.

It says that there’s an overwhelming likelihood that Yale gets half to two-thirds of cross-admits - and, conversely, a negligible likelihood that Penn gets more than half - surprising no one. And we’re apparently in violent agreement that a lot of what Penn gets is due to Wharton. Yale and Penn’s bioengineering programs and med schools appear to be in the same band, such that I don’t believe there’s a big difference between them. This is why I’m saying that if you wouldn’t pick Georgia Tech or UCSD for undergrad bioengineering, then you’re picking Yale or Penn for other reasons than pure excellence in that narrow field. On the other hand, I believe Yale Law (top in the country) is clearly better than Penn Law, and Wharton (arguably top three)  is clearly better than Yale SOM, so the choices would be much more straightforward.  ```\\n',\n",

Its not the cost of the undergraduate, but the total cost of undergraduate plus medical school.  Its also the ability to fulfill the dreams of a medical career.  It is not accurate to say that GT will necessarily produce the same result, although it could.  You are assuming that going to GT will lead to the same medical school and same cost as Harvard.  I am not assuming anything.  The facts show that Harvard students obtain admission to elite medical schools at a much higher rate.  Go onto the websites of the top medical schools and see how many came from Harvard and how many from GT.  Now, I don’t think it is a mistake to go to GT.  It is a great school and free.  If you do extraordinarily well, you will get into medical school and maybe get merit money.  Life doesn’t give you pat answers.  But, I guess I just don’t get the simplistic analysis that Harvard or other elite schools are just “prestige” or “names.”  They offer a lot beyond the name and here it is a fact that those resources lead to admission to top medical schools at much higher rate than GT and likely a much higher cost.  If you give that up fine, but don’t argue that all you are giving up is a name.  ```\\n',\n",

I thought GT was a match for me (34, Top 3% class, 3.9 UW) until I got deferred EA as well as some of my very qualified classmates.

I was only looking at Computer Science. For a ME, EE, ChemE, choosing Michigan over an Ivy if it is cheaper seems to be more clear cut for most students. The pay range is much smaller for these majors and the related jobs. “But even then, the advantage when it comes to placing graduates in companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft clearly favors Michigan, even over the likes of Cornell” These 4 companies seem to be the focus of Michigan graduates. I think a lot of grads at Ivies have those options too, but may simply decide that other offers are better for them. Those 4 are not necessarily superior to other options: Facebook, AirBnB, Lyft, Bloomberg, Jane Street, D. E. Shaw, Drop Box, Palantir, etc. I think the better job depends on many factors: the specific duties, compensation, location, etc. “In the case of Michigan (and Northwestern), approximately 50% work in the Midwest. The cost of living in the Midwest is significantly lower than the cost of living in cities like DC, NYC and Boston, and the starting salaries will usually reflect the cost of living.” I don’t understand this. I don’t think that many top CS jobs exist in the midwest that would be comparable to SF, NYC, Seattle, or Boston. There are probably a reasonable number of comparable positions in Chicago, and I am sure there are a few startups in Ann Arbor, but if a large number of CS students are staying in Michigan, then I would think that suggests that they are not getting similar positions.  ```\\n',\n",

So it really depends on exactly what type of engineer you want to become, as to whether Caltech is a good fit.  Caltech is more of a chemistry, math and physics focused school, but the math will prepare students for a career in fluid mechanics for instance.  Thats the science that describes how an airplane moves through the air , the air being a “fluid”. For an undergrad in BME, the chemistry at Caltech, might be compelling, but I would say JHU, Caltech or GaTech are about the same for BME.   Maybe GaTech a tad better, IF the student wants to design prosthesis, the best artificial heart, etc, because GaTech has such a tight relationship with Emory U Medical and has arguably very good mechanical engineering training. All BMEs are going to get more education. So its also a personal preference, does the student  want hot dry Pasadena, a small town, with great access to Los Angeles, or the big bustling city of Atlanta, with sports, hiking, rock climbing close by, or the sailing and crab cakes  that Baltimore offers, with access to Washington DC?  ```\\n',\n",

My roommate went to tons of parties and still did well enough to get into Columbia med with a 3.7 GPA from Hopkins.  Some of it is intelligence - another is time management.  In no way are students going out of their way to not help one another.  People know Hopkins is tough - but this fosters camaraderie since people have the same common goal.  The acceptance rate to Harvard med is like 3% - do people have much to gain by not helping their fellow man when 2 minds are better than one? I personally was not premed, but I was 1 bio course and 1 orgo course away from being one, and I did fine. The only people that complain and moan about premed at Hopkins are ones that did not go there or had a tough time collaborating (luckily these are in the far minority).  ```\\n',\n",

With respect to major choices that might be appropriate, you might consider computer science, math, physics, economics, or a combination from this group. In terms of post-graduate earnings potential, early career salaries can be found through U.S. News. Hamilton appears highest among the NESCAC LACs in this area.

And given how large the school is, the alum network is not only strong but large.  Someone brought up a point about if the OP wants to get a venture funded, s/he would be better off with an MIT background… I’m not sure that’s necessarily true.  It’s highly likely the UMich network would be helpful for funding, not something to be overlooked. Much of this is a question about how much money a small difference is worth to an individual.  Only OP knows his family’s financial situation, but for most people with a financial situation with less than 9 figures in net worth, $250k is a substantial investment.  Would MIT be “better” for some things if cost were equal?  Sure.  But arguing that the differential is worth $250k is a much tougher sell, especially since the alternative (UMich) is of such high quality.  ```\\n',\n",

Never got a NY “wanna be” vibe at Vassar, felt very down to earth, not pretentious, and I appreciated the formerly-women’s college vibe of a school with no football team and no greek life. Kenyon feels – your mileage may vary – like a place where city, private school kids go. Of course, that is not the only demographic at Kenyon, but it definitely feels more wealthy, more homogenous (and is) than some peer schools. Greek life is about 25% at Kenyon, and though students don’t live in the greek life houses, the housing office designates certain blocks of dorm rooms  for members of specific chapters, so that greek life members live together. So yes, I agree with other posters that I perceive the schools the flip of how you did. But I’m a middle aged mom, so take it with a grain of salt.  ```\\n',\n",

Olin College of Engineering```\\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\\nComment: ```Olin only has about 320 students … so sometimes I think of almost as a very large co-ed frat.   There is a tendency for students to stay on campus.   The academic and project load is intense (as it would be at GT too I’m sure), but the students seem to thrive on the challenge.   They are often on that Olin bubble, but liking it.   Having said that, my son did get off campus.  One of his research things was  joint project with Wellesly.    I’d guess he went to Boston about once a month.  He rode his bike and ran a lot too.   For him, most interests/ECs involved music, which he did on campus.   Oh yea, he also tutored some local kids and did a morning math(?) program at a local school. “I love meeting new people and working with those who are different from me.” -   That definitely could be a concern regarding “fit”.    The Oliners have a wide variety of interests, more so than in many engineering programs.  But they are still all very STEM-focused.   To give an example, there is a Saturday night club called “Midnight Mathematicians”.   I kid you not… they meet at midnight and take turns presenting on math topics.  ```\\n',\n",

I believe the closest field at Stanford is Human Biology, which was Stanford’s most popular major until the recent CS boom.   It’s an  interdisciplinary field that lets you design a customized program based on your interests and goals, choosing courses from a good variety of other fields, outside of human biology classes.  Stanford is big on such  interdisciplinary programs like this, coterm degrees that combine BS+MS, etc.  I’m not as familiar with the options at Princeton, but I do see that they offer the option to supplement major with Global Health and Health Policy and obtain a related certification, which Stanford does not have an equivalent…  [quote] Weather would typically not be a factor for me at all, except for the fact I am a recruited athlete and would have to train year round. Rowing, in winter, is not particularly pleasant as it’s long months of indoor training which I would find at Princeton. At Stanford, we can be on the water all year round (sun!). That being said I grew up on the West Coast and wouldn’t mind a change of scenery. [/quote]  I’ve lived on both the east and west coast, and have rowed at Stanford.  I found the rowing at Stanford to be rough on mornings when it was cold and/or raining.   I imagine this would be quite a bit worse at Princeton with more extreme temps and triple the rain, but that may be just me.   I think I am more sensitive to weather than most, or maybe I’ve become spoiled by living in CA for so long. This brings up another relevant point.    I grew up in upstate NY. I currently live in CA, largely because of the large CA presence at Stanford job fairs, and because I enjoyed the CA area while at Stanford. If you want to live/work/internship in the SV or CA area, Stanford has a strong edge. Similarly, I’m sure the Princeton area has a strong college presence and a large number of area companies with special network/internship areas.  If you’d like to live/work/internship in the Princeton area or are interested in IB/wall street, Princeton would have a big edge.  ```\\n',\n",

She had a range from no aid to very good merit. We really, really struggled with the decision, but it came down to Cornell, ranked #11 for engineering, and VT, ranked #14. Cornell was too expensive for us, and the other schools just didn’t measure up. She cried for 24 hours, then she was over it. She is finishing up her freshman year. She made Deans list last semester (no worries about getting her first choice major) She lives in the engineering housing (Lee Hall, Hypatia  for women, Galileo for men) which has probably made a difference- everyone is taking the same classes and so they all have to study at the same times, no pressure to party when you should study. My favorite part? Everyone seems so happy to be there. When we were wandering around campus trying to come to terms with turning down “an Ivy” , kids would literally just start talking to us. “Would your daughter like to see my dorm room? I live in Lee Hall” or telling us about their plans for graduate school, how their classes went, what they thought about work-life balance. Literally random girls we met while petting their dogs. Tons of cute dogs. The parents we met at restaurants were nice, and many were alums. They showed us photos of their kids, they asked us to let them know what she decided. Every single person we met was so great. There were NINE rainbows on our drive home. It was just so great. It IS so great. My friend is a CEO of a tech company in the research triangle. She says “some of the best engineers I hire are VT grads” I’m sorry, I am a little biased, but, really, it’s the whole package. Rutgers is basically a commuter campus. I don’t know much about PSU engineering.  ```\\n',\n",

I went to Duke, D will be going to Brown, and we both loved Berkeley when we visited for a 2 day program.  Although Duke is located in the South, most of the kids come from the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, California and Florida.  Duke does not feel like a Southern school and even though it’s not located in a major city, there is constantly a lot going on with incredible speakers from all over the world and all sorts of research opportunities.  After taking the college tour, my D’s comment was “mom, there is so much going on there, it feels like they are throwing opportunities at you.”  FWIW, Melinda Gates went to Duke and has donated a lot of money there.  Duke is constantly is reaching out to its Alumni to create internships and all sorts of learning opportunities for its students.  Brown does as well: as a parent of a committed student I was already sent  information requests about whether there was anything I could contribute career-wise, and I know an alum who mentors kids in her industry.   Both Brown and Duke are well represented in Silicon Valley. I think of the social life at Brown and Berkeley being similar.  Both are very collaborative places and the kids are very liberal and accepting.   Duke has more social striation and Greek life can be important.  Berkeley ultimately came off our list because we were concerned about the huge class sizes and ability to get the classes you want.  I also felt that the advising programs at Brown and Duke were better.  If we were in-state for Berkeley, my D would have gone there, but I just couldn’t see paying the out of state price when I think you get less services than you do at the privates. But these were our impressions. Hopefully others can give you theirs too so you can get a better feel about if there’s a consistent theme.   Good luck, and you really can’t go wrong. Once you choose, don’t look back, only look forward.  ```\\n',\n",

VT has a very large Career Fair. There are  detailed post grad surveys available  online and VT engineers are very well recruited by many different companies. Of course, Cornell is an excellent choice as well. Any of these schools will provide an excellent education. She may do best at the school she feels most comfortable at, which may not end up being where others think she should go or want her to go ! Good luck with the decision!  ```\\n',\n",

I would not consider a 3+2 program as a realistic option. Very few students end up doing them, which requires switching colleges after your junior year. I think the focus should be whether you really want to start out as pre-med or in engineering. GA Tech likely is a GPA killer for med school, especially if you are in engineering. But if you want to be an engineer, GA Tech is amazing. If you start out at Hamilton or Wesleyan and decide not to do pre-med, you could get a masters in engineering (with an extra year or two of school elsewhere), though that is sub-optimal compared to just going to GA Tech. Tough decision. If you can visit all of them, that would probably knock one or two of them out.  ```\\n',\n",

One thing to consider, even for good students, is that pre-med is time consuming. Having to work while in school is a huge disadvantage. If you go to medical school then at some point in the future you will have a similar choice: do I work where I fit or where the prestige is highest? At Harvard you will be a dime a dozen. At Georgia Tech they are rolling out the red carpet and pre-selecting you as a standout for whom they are providing a standout experience. In the future, do you take a job somewhere with low taxes, low cost of living, lots of autonomy but away from big city amenities; or do you live in a crappy condo, pay half your money in taxes, spend 10% of your life in traffic, but work at a prestigious facility? In the end, it is your call!  ```\\n',\n",

In other words, is it a short-term or a long-term goal? Will you be an average or top contributor at P, at S? Have you done any research on which college supports athletes better adapt to rigorous academic environment? What are their graduation success rate like? (These are available from their respective athletic depts.) Regarding academic life: Do you prefer a larger school setting or a smaller LAC-like school? For comparison, Stanford has about 2,000 more undergrad students than Princeton, which has about 5,200. Stanford’s grad student population is about 11,000 whereas Princeton’s grad student population is about half of its undergrad population at 2,700. Stanford has Med, Law and Business schools. By institutional design, Princeton doesn’t. There are pros and cons to either environment, and it’s up to each individual student preference. What do you intend to major in? Which school has greater strength in your area of academic interest? What resources does each school have for assisting you towards your career path given your major? What pedagogical style do you prefer? Princeton has the Preceptorial Method which is a modified Oxford tutorial learning environment with 5:1 student-teacher ratio. I’m not as familiar with Stanford’s pedagogical methods, so I’ll leave that for other knowledgeable folks to contribute here. Princeton has residential college (6) system, and each college where you’d be housed is staffed by 1) the college dean, 2) director of studies, 3) faculty advisers, 4) peer academic advisers and 5) director of student life, a staff member dedicated to support your health and well being. Again, I’m not familiar with Stanford counterpart to this so I’ll leave this up to others to contribute here. You can’t go wrong with either of these great institutions. However, they’re very different in culture and experience, so do make a wise decision based on YOUR personality and needs. One big mistake I’ve seen so many young students make is going with what their peers think are a greater choice when instead they need to really dig into their self-knowledge of who they’re and what they want to accomplish in life. In other words, DON’T go with either the Ivy hype or the Stanford hype. Go with what’d fulfill your life in the long run.  ```\\n',\n",

NYC or Boston are very different from Dallas, Austin, or Bloomington. Each has advantages and disadvantages. Note: ask whether dorms have A/C.

So this very lucky kid should go to where this kid wants to go. Which is probably Columbia. [/quote]  It’s nowhere near that simple. The strength of preference is an important consideration, as is where the 180K goes if they do not spend it. If I as the student got to keep that 180K for post-grad to invest or buy a house or a car or get ahead in various ways financially, Columbia is in no way worth it. If that 180K means my parents can retire two or three years earlier, that’s a consideration as well. It’s a conversation to have with them.  [quote] The kid expresses a clear preference for the Columbia “experience” over the nearby State U “experience” (even though the State U here is one of the best state Us there is). [/quote]  I’m not sure where you’re getting this strong strength of preference which you have been using as part of your argument all thread. The quotes below are the only mentions of preference in the thread by the OP:  [quote] I prefer Columbia but I’m not sure it’s worth the additional $180,000. [/quote]   [quote] NYC definitely has that extra appeal to me but the money of course is a huge drawback. [/quote]  Not to mention that the OP originally mentions going to grad school. You also keep insisting price is not important when the OP explicitly states that it is a factor for them.  All of this also ignores the possibility that Michigan for CS could be the better choice in a vacuum for some students, possibly this one, given the additional information in this thread (unfortunately buried in tangents).  Hunt’s analysis does indeed lay it out well. While very helpful, it doesn’t answer the question for this specific case.  ```\\n',\n",

OP, the only thing that’s tugging at you is the brand name of Yale.  Funny thing about college choice: it is both a significant but a not-so-really life-altering decision as people think.  The decision about where to attend seems bigger than it really is.  For instance, many, many students wish they could be in your shoes and attend Madison. Another issue, and I hope this isn’t too personal.  But if you are expected to pay full freight at Yale, this means that your family is full pay.  I understand that some full pay families are right on the bubble, expected to cover the complete COA even though a family might feel that this is beyond their means.  However, if I am reading things right, your family is willing to pay 220K towards your Yale education, and you are expected to handle the remaining 60K? Question: why aren’t you or your parents suggesting what strikes me as the obvious?  “Son (or dear daughter), you will attend UW-Madison, and we will finance your medical school costs up to 220K.”  In other words, if medical school is in your future, why spend so much of everyone’s money (yours (in the form of future debt) and your parents’) on undergrad?  Am I missing something? If your family could comfortably afford Yale, that would be different.  If the debt were lower (let’s say 30K, which many students do take on; debt is the reality for most college students), maybe that would change things, too (even though I don’t think Yale is worth 30K in debt, not when the other option is practically free).  I wish you the best, though.  ```\\n',\n",

My advice is to go to office hours, sign up for Lion tutors, create peer study groups, etc.  and try to do as many math courses as possible at your community college over the summer and transfer them in. Just make sure you confirm with an adviser that they will be accepted before doing so. 4 - PSU engineeeing is super tough but they are in high demand.

They advised us that they do not consider scholarships awarded from other universities. We received a good package, but year 4 is making it look  impossible because my EFC will go up 40% (GU explained that they split the EFC between two kids as 60/40) ```\\n',\n",

Students going into CS at a highly selective state flagship or private school known for CS should not be surprised that the popularity of the CS major means large classes.  Even places like Stanford and Harvard (700) and Harvey Mudd (200) have large class sizes for their introductory CS courses.  ```\\n',\n",

Usually courses that lean more on reasoning and analytical problem solving cause even the highest SAT/ACT scorers trouble because it isn’t enough to simply know the content or knowing every problem type you’ve been exposed to while studying.  Usually such instructors get the “tests us on stuff we didn’t learn” reputation.  To me this is code for: “This instructor surprises students and makes them think about what they learned in a seemingly unfamiliar context or maybe even requires some creativity”.  Most students, including high achievers seem really comfy with neat and predictable and as an educator, you probably know what that may entail in a college classroom or any classroom. I’ve met many students (I am among them) who are comfortable with courses that involve more conceptual logic and reasoning, but it seems like the vast majority prefer what I described earlier and that makes sense because it is how many of us were trained prior to college (heavily coached and spoonfed material and told exactly what was on a test and how it would be tested).  There is a reason so many students find organic chemistry, for example, an oddball.  Forget it if you integrate lots of reasoning into biology courses.  Unless they are a majority of the bio curric.,at a school, said courses will be avoided like the plague because that isn’t how most people’s biology courses went in high school (they were often just content overload).  I guess I just paint “challenging” as whatever forces most students out of their comfort zone or upsets previous ways of obtaining knowledge/studying.  For most it would be STEM courses with less memorization or with instructors who throw critical thinking oriented “curveballs” as many call it.  It’s why I always relate the two (difficulty and style of assessment and course delivery).  My opinion is that every STEM major should graduate knowing how to use the knowledge or at least understand reasoning in the field, and yes most will enter college with different readiness levels to make that adjustment. You’ll notice that at selective schools, the courses that mostly assess basic understanding and remembering/identifying have 85+ course averages.  One has to go to higher levels of Bloom to get 70 and 60 averages.  ```\\n',\n",

Just how much is this the case there, and how would it affect someone not active in athletics? (My son played soccer in high school, also some ultimate and tennis, but he is not at a level to play on a college team.) [/quote]  I don’t think this will be a big deal at either school. At most schools, even SLACs, athletes (and the men/women attracted to them) often form cliques. It goes hand in hand with team bonding. However, it usually doesn’t affect other students, unless they are dying to be part of who they perceive to be the “in” crowd and get rejected. And we’re not talking about giant powerhouses of NCAA Division I here.  [quote] The study abroad program [/quote]  We like Carleton’s specific options, but both schools will offer excellent opportunities. One difference worth noting: the Carleton trimester-based academic calendar enables a student with demanding academic requirements (for a double major, for example) to go abroad for the six-week winter break (Thanksgiving to New Year’s) or for a 10-week trimester. In the latter case, the student can still take classes in Northfield for the other two trimesters, if desired. (Or you can go abroad for half a year to a year.)  [quote] We’re in Illinois, and one of my son’s preferences is to get out of the midwest. (I’m from the east coast originally, and still have family there.) [/quote]  There you go. Amherst wins, if this is important to your son. For us, it was the opposite. My daughter will be experiencing something very different by going to the Midwest, which is one reason she turned down all of her California choices. I agree with your son that it is important to explore something different.  [quote] Amherst’s endowment is quite a bit larger – does that have much of an impact on differences between the schools? [/quote]  Not that I noticed, but there may some advantages. Amherst has a slightly better student:faculty ratio. My impression is that Amherst provides slightly better financial aid, but each person’s experience may be different. On the other hand, Amherst has a higher sticker price, and Carleton spends more on R&D (can’t find my source, but I saw the figures somewhere). So who knows?  [quote] Financial aid: Amherst’s aid is “no loan”. Does that mean we can’t do a loan (i.e., the Federal Direct Stafford loan) even if we want to? And if we can, would it be on top of the grant they’ve already given us, or would it displace some of it? (Their website seems to suggest the former; I plan to speak with their FA office tomorrow.) With the loan, the FA packages are very similar. [/quote]  You can always borrow a Parent Plus loan up to the expected family contribution. It will not replace any grants or scholarships. Eligibility for Federal Stafford loans, subsidized or unsubsidized, should be stated on the financial aid offer. Good luck! As others will tell you, your son can’t go wrong with either choice. Great schools.  ```\\n',\n",

During the first quarter, there were no shortage of conversations that, while perhaps not at the level of Plato’s Dialogues, certainly concerned themselves with Plato’s Dialogues. Discussions spilled out of the classroom and into the dining hall and later into the lounge. They’ve since moved well past Plato and Aristotle and more recent discussions are about Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Marx and W. E. B. Du Bois. There are no right or wrong answers to the choice between taking a full-tuition scholarship at USC versus being full pay at Stanford, and it is completely dependent upon a variety of other factors involving all aspects of fit – academic, social, intellectual, and economic.  ```\\n',\n",

But by the end of the day its where you wanted to be and that makes it the right choice. I was one of the earliest posters and keep in mind all the good things I said “The University of South Carolina Darla Moore International School of Business is rated number one by all accounts. It is NOT an easy school to get into. Having said that, my best friend son graduated from this school last year. He did an internship at Google in Ann Arbor (yes Google is in Ann Arbor) and was offered employment once he graduated. He was super driven and he did a few abroad studies in Spain, Denmark, and I believe even in Brazil. The school IB department is fabulous and competitive. Having said that, his only REGRET was that he did not go to a higher ranked or overall better named school . The overall Business School is good but not like the IB department and not as selective. At the time he was applying to colleges,USC was the most affordable option and that is where he ended up going. He knows that the fact that he graduated for USC did NOT affect internship or job opportunities. He has done quite well for a 23 year old.”  ```\\n',\n",

When I look back at Amherst, the STEM classes launched my career path…but if I had to list the 10 most memorable classes/professors I encountered while I was there…7-8 would be non-STEM.  The open curriculum allowed me to follow my career interests while taking advantage of the greatest resource the school has to offer…its teachers. Last August I spoke with a Physics prof at Amherst.  He was already making preparations to move his lab to the new science building.  Very excited about it.  If your son chooses Amherst, those facilities will come online right when he would need them.  ```\\n',\n",

She had some good choices, like your daughter, and I didn’t think SMU was going to make the top 3.  After final visits to the other choices - and none of them feeling quite right - she made a trip to SMU by herself for an admitted student weekend.  Within the first few hours, she knew she had found her place.  She works hard at her studies (she is an engineering major) but has had the time and opportunity to be involved with a few campus organizations.  Because she has been involved and met lots of different people, she has had a very good experience so far.  Sounds like your daughter has some great options.  Obviously there were more highly ranked options for engineering schools but we weren’t entirely sure she would enjoy engineering and hoped she would choose a school with lots of other options if she decided to change majors.  Rankings are important, I guess, but we didn’t really care all that much.  Factors like travel distance (she’s 1000 miles away but a short, relatively inexpensive direct flight), job / internship opportunities in large city (Dallas), active campus ministry (we are Catholic), affordability with merit scholarships, and a small, supportive engineering program played into her decision more than any ranking.  ```\\n',\n",

However, I suspect that the average and below average Michigan students may not be so competitive and that may bring their average down.” Much2learn, the range of Michigan students enrolled in the CoE is similar to the students enrolled at Cornell or Penn. There is no difference in the quality of the students. There may have been a slight difference in quality in the 90s and 00s, but the gap has closed entirely in recent years. There are simple reasons for the small gap in starting pay. First of all, Cornell’s data is for 2017, while Penn and Michigan’s reports are for 2016 graduates. That alone accounts for a 3%-4% difference in pay. Second, the makeup of the students in the engineering programs. For example, at Michigan, most engineering students (over 70%) major in Aerospace, Civil, Chemical, Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical etc…Those aren’t the highest paid Engineering disciplines. At Penn, roughly 50% major in CS, CE-related majors, which pay significantly more. In this regard, Cornell, Michigan and Northwestern have a more balanced concentration of majors than Penn, which seems to lean heavily on CS/CE majors. But even then, the advantage when it comes to placing graduates in companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft clearly favors Michigan, even over the likes of Cornell: Michigan: 149 Penn: 39 Cornell: 38 Michigan is obviously twice larger than Cornell and three times larger than Penn (although Penn has roughly almost as many CS/CE majors as Michigan), but advantage in the number placed in those tippy top Tech firms clearly favors Michigan. Third, while many CS majors end up in Silicon Valley, the majority, certainly over 50%, will work regionally. For example, according to Penn’s report, close to 60% of Penn graduates took jobs in the Mid Atlantic (DC to NYC) and Northeast (mostly Boston). In the case of Michigan (and Northwestern), approximately 50% work in the Midwest. The cost of living in the Midwest is significantly  lower than the cost of living in cities like DC, NYC and Boston, and the starting salaries will usually reflect the cost of living. Since 50%-60% of the graduates work and live regionally, it stands to reason that those take jobs in the most expensive region will have higher starting salaries.  That can easily account for the 15% gap between Michigan (and other Midwestern schools like Northwestern and UIUC) and East Coast universities (like Cornell and Penn). Below are the average starting salaries Engineering/CS graduates: Cornell: $79,000 Michigan: $76,000 Northwestern: $70,000 Penn: $88,000 https://issuu.com/nucareeradvance/docs/beyond_northwestern_handout_2016_fi http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/resources/career_services/students/statistics/upload/Undergraduate-Class-of-2016.pdf  ```\\n',\n",

Here’s a map. http://www.thevillageclaremont.com/map.html. I’m tagging @nostalgicwisdom for more feedback. I will say that the Pomona CS Department is struggling with the same issues as HMC’s, which is demand that exceeds the amount of faculty available. Basically you have to be a CS major to have the necessary priority to get in classes. They will hold spaces in the introductory classes for the incoming freshmen, but after that you’d better declare a CS major asap. My D is an Econ major who is trying to complete a CS minor and she was shut out of the class she wanted last Spring semester as a junior. Generally cross-registration is easy and seamless but be aware that for your major some departments will require that you complete certain courses at Pomona (e.g., the Econ department requires that you take the 6 core classes for the major at Pomona). My D is currently doing an internship one of the Federal Reserve Banks. She’s only been there a few days but her boss, a senior Research Economist at the Fed, told her that she is on the “right tail” in terms of the amount of research experience that his interns have had.  ```\\n',\n",

CMU does not have nearly the resources of Penn. For example, the Penn endowment is almost 10 times larger than CMU’s. From my perspective, it is pretty clear that Penn offers you the best opportunity. The important thing for you is getting a lot of guidance on how to capitalize on all of those opportunities. The opportunities they offer will not benefit you if you don’t know they exist or how to access and prioritize them. That is why I recommend that you begin by discussing that with an admissions counselor. Penn has incredible opportunities, but it is also fairly large and complex. Someone with experience can be a big help in guiding you in capturing the best opportunities that are aligned with your interests.  ```\\n',\n",

Neither is “better” than the other, and neither will provide its graduates with better odds at success. McGill obviously has a stronger reputation globally. Few people outside of the Northeast have even heard of MHC. but where it really matters, among graduate school admissions committees and potential employers, I think the two are highly regarded. I would recommend going for fit. McGill is a large, urban, coeducational, public research university. MHC is small, private, rural-ish, women’s liberal arts college. This is a fairly easy choice if you ask me. Where would intstudent2021 be happier?  ```\\n',\n",

Your ECs are impressive, so I doubt that has been/will be an issue for acceptances. I don’t know the detail and rigor of your HS courses, but your ACT score is below the 25% level for several of the schools you applied to. Fordham and Babson acceptances are higher probability than the rest of the schools on your list, and most of the rest I would classify as high reaches (with Villanova a reach). Don’t fret over decisions until you are faced with them…if you need summer earnings to pay for college, I would choose Pitt over Smeal summer…but only you can make these decisions. Good luck, keep us updated.  ```\\n',\n",

Between Kelley and Cox that is more of a best fit question.  The entirety of SMU undergrad is the size of Kelley, so that is more just a question of what she is interested in class sie, whether, etc.  Many of the kids I go to school with were in at ut mccombs, and chose SMU.  They were not plan 2 or mccombs honors though - those are on another level. Great opportunities for sure wherever she may go.  ```\\n',\n",

I too have friends that did pre-med (and are still there) at Hopkins as did my roommate, so I’d think being closer to the vest is more reputed than your third hand assertions. Cornell selectivity is also not quite apples to apples since they have a CALS division. What’s also clear is that Hopkins is enrolling more academically accomplished students (similar to what Northwestern began doing in the past) - while still maintaining yield, which makes the lower yield more impressive than Cornell or Dartmouth.  Hopkins also isn’t just taking high scorers with potential lower rank ala vandy (with 87% ranked in top 10%) SATs of enrolled freshman: Hopkins: SAT (M+V old scale):1420 to 1570 Freshman in top 10%: 94% Cornell: SAT (M+V old scale):1330 to 1520 Freshman in top 10%: 90%  ```\\n',\n",

Cornell is great but it doesn’t automatically lead to a life of leisure and riches or guaranteed happiness. If so your hubby would write s check for all four years and be done with it. It’s a long life and being happy is more important in the end than anything. Any of these schools offer your d a great chance at all that is good in life and a great engineering job if that what she wants. Tell him to let her grow and be independent.

OU has one of the top meteorology programs in the country. UIC Nursing is highly respected. In each of those fields, those schools are considered powerhouses. For instance, design people could care less about Cincy’s USNews ranking. They care more about the fact that Cincy design grads are top-notch. BTW, the USNews rankings can be gamed. I would not rely on them. I personally prefer my tiers based off of alumni achievements: https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/1893105-ivy-equivalents-ranking-based-on-alumni-outcomes-take-2-1-p1.html Those can not be gamed.  ```\\n',\n",

Her friend group is geographically pretty diverse, and generally speaking (at least from her experience) students really don’t know/care who is full pay or who gets financial aid. Of course there are always exceptions at every school but middkids are a prety down to earth group.  I do, however, agree with @doschicos that Bates is arguably the most laid back of the three you are considering. On a side note- when my daughter visited Williams she spent the day on campus. Attended class, danced in the studio, tried to take in as much as possible. She did feel the environment was intense at Williams, that it had a similar feel to Swarthmore, and for that reason Williams did fall off of her list. At Middlebury the students seemed like they were having fun; at Williams not so much that particular day. Having said that, she has two friends at Williams and they absolutely love Williams! Bottom line is that all three are great school and the comparisons are truly relative and certainly subjective   ```\\n',\n",

You can then evaluate the total difference in price. Keep in mind that going away also has some downsides- you won’t be able to go home for the weekend if you need to de-stress from your crazy roommate or if you are sick, travel is a lot more expensive (you’ll probably fly for Thanksgiving break, at least), and you’ll miss family events. Also consider the following: Is your OOS scholarship guaranteed? Do you have to maintain a certain GPA? What if you need a 5th year? What is the cost of study abroad? Do you pay your current tuition or some different amount? What are the reciprocal schools? If you change your mind and switch majors, what is the effect on cost, graduation, etc.? What are the most common firms hiring from the program, starting salary, etc. etc. ?  ```\\n',\n",

It just said “Georgetown Scholarship” for part of the award. If you have not already contacted your individual financial aid POC, I would do so now to make sure that your package is in process. The financial aid POC was great, and told us when a decision has been made and when to expect it.  There are listings by last name on the web site. My son is currently weighing Georgetown SFS and UVA.  Will be headed to GAAP on 4/20.  Decisions, decisions. Good luck.  ```\\n',\n",

Each is a little different, and take my impresions with a grain of salt as they are subjective of course. I think (overall) all three schools are pretty equal in your academic areas of interest- some might be stronger than others in certain areas but overall it’s relative as all three are top notch schools. Bates- wonderful community. Gorgeous (although small) campus/architecture. Very friendly vibe, students are welcoming and the close knit community feel is palpable. Strong academics, just a lovely school. Has the month long May plan which is useful for starting summer internships early or for traveling abroad. Major difference to me between it and the other two is a more laid back vibe. Doesn’t feel as intense. Definitely collaborative. Best food of the three. Nephew is a current student. D15 would have applied regular decision if her ED school had fallen through. Bates is very high on D18’s list this year. Bowdoin- neat school. Lovely campus in it’s own quirky way. Location near Portland is nice, it is more suburban than rural if that matters to you. Great if you like the ocean. Pretty far away from mountains though if you like having them in your back yard. Of course great academics. Personally, I sensed a little more academic elitism at Bowdoin than the other three. I don’t mean it in a bad way, and perhaps I have used the wrong word. Just seemed a little bit more academcially snobby than the other two. Not sure how collaborative/competitive, don’t know enough kids who go there.  D15 liked Bowdoin a lot, would have applied if her ED school fell through. D18 didn’t even look at Bowdoin, too intense of a school for her. Middlebury- awesome location in the mountains, lovely campus. Feels considerably bigger than the other two schools. D15 went ED and attends. Loving her expereince, it is the right mix of academic intensity and fun for her. Raves about (most) of the professors/classes she has taken. Has found Midd more collaborative than competitive (she is env policy major). Heavily involved in the Mountain Club. Knows women on the cross country/track team and they are a great group. Jan Plan is very popular- fun to have the one block class in the middle of ski season. Lots of students ski. D18 not interested in Midd, a bit too intense for her. Good luck!  ```\\n',\n",

I can only speak about PSU, but supposedly only 1 in 3 who start in engineeeing actually graduate with an engineering degree. It’s pretty brutal but that’s also why a lot of recruiters hire students from there. You could also compare the entrance to major requirements between schools. At PSU no one is technically accepted into their major. Rather they have to take a handful of required courses and hit a certain GPA before officially declaring it.  ```\\n',\n",

I do know you can – and will – get a great education at UW-Madison. We have a son who opted for Madison, loves it and just three days ago was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa there as a junior. He studies hard, has ECs, and I’m sure you will, too, and that you would not lose your scholarship. It’s good to learn that Madison now offers scholarships to out-of-state and Minn. reciprocity students, unlike three years ago. The monetary resources that you would save by enrolling at Madison would be available for medical school. It would be a treat to enter residency without $300,000+ of med school debt. BTW – let us know in two weeks what choice you make. You’ll likely change your mind twice a day until you feel good about a decision.  ```\\n',\n",

I wouldn’t bank on merit aid as their stats are pretty similar to Emory’s (Emory just gets higher app. volume).  You would not stand out at either statistically. Also please please please stop asking:  “Which one will give you the higher GPA?”.  Ain’t nobody GIVING you nothing! It makes you sound like a bad applicant to either who isn’t worried about learning and who believes that getting a higher GPA is a matter of choosing the right elite school.  That makes no sense.  In addition, it is a horrible question because we don’t know what you will major in, the courses and professors you would take at each, and how they will grade.  We don’t know, so stop asking. Leave your confusion behind on the medical school admit rates.  You either have a great application or you don’t.  If you went to a state school with a 35% rate but were excellent versus the rest of the student body and your performance reflected it, you would very likely get in unless you can’t interview well.  There are so many things that affect these numbers that you need to just stop being confused, visit places and choose somewhere you actually fit, and do well.  That is how you get to your next destination.  These percentages have nothing to do with what YOU and your situation and performance will be.  Either take that to heart or remain confused and go to Rochester or wherever else. You already asked about competition and I don’t know anything about UR’s academic environment.  Emory’s was already answered. Your thing about weed-out is just false (UR has engineering, and engineering curricula everywhere and especially at selective schools are very challenging, but that has nothing to do with pre-med classes.  From my comparisons of course materials in the life sciences, Emory is among the harder schools ranked between 13 and 25 or so).  Every student at every damned school claims that pre-med courses are weedouts.  If you compared the actual courses between elite schools you would either find out that there is no difference, or that one student body was exaggerating to a ridiculous extent.  If you want to keep saying this with no evidence than hearsay, please avoid Emory because what you “heard” will lead you to a path of misery.   Pre-med is going to be hard at any selective university.  To even try to split hairs between selective schools without seeing course materials is a waste of time so stop doing it.  If you are concerned, choose schools much less selective than either of these and stop saying this part and the stuff about the GPA every time you post.  ```\\n',\n",

I have yet to meet a college student who says there isn’t a lot of drinking on their campus - whether it is a big school, small school, rural, urban, etc. I have a friend whose daughter is a freshman at ND and her roommate is drinking four nights a week. The dorm is a party. My niece is a freshman at a big ten school. All kinds of drinking. I’m guessing that, at most schools, students can choose to drink or not drink and it’s their own choice. Both my friend’s daughter and our niece have chosen to find like-minded kids in their classes and in club activities and they do not drink. But, yes, Kenyon is rural. Probably about as rural as they get. Lots of kids like that about rural LACs. I’m guessing it’s figured out early on in most kids’ searches if they like that kind of campus or not. We know two kids at Kenyon (both athletes). They don’t drink, have tons of friends, and think the professors are out of this world.  ```\\n',\n",

As for switching majors, you may do so at both Columbia  and Michigan, and still go on to have an excellent education regardless since both universities are excellent across virtually all disciplines.  ```\\n',\n",

What they care more about is how to become the next Elon Musk or how to become a successful startup founder, if not to work for those giant tech companies in the Bay Area and make six-figure salary (excluding bonus) as just entrants. That doesn’t make Berkeley engineering inferior to Duke simply because the school doesn’t have the same culture as Duke’s. And, btw, what is Oxford engineering compared to Berkeley’s!  ```\\n',\n",

Visited both schools with my daughter and full disclosure am a Vassar grad. My daughter and I found the opposite of what you’re expecting about the students. Vassar students were more down to earth, seemed happy and I would not describe as New York wanna bes. We both found more of a pretentious vibe at Kenyon and not one person looked up or smiled. The folks in admissions, including the student interviewer my daughter met with, were down right rude with a snobby air. Also Kenyon is very isolated so that’s a consideration as well. Poughkeepsie leaves a lot to be desired but the area around campus is nice and NYC is an option although it’s not so close that you’d be heading there every weekend. We saw confederate flags all over the area near Kenyon - a huge turn off for us at least. I know others will have other opinions - maybe we just hit Kenyon on a bad day.  Best of luck.  ```\\n',\n",

As you can see from the link you provided, most of the universities at the top are concentrated in California and the East Coast, where the cost of living is significantly higher than the cost of living in the Midwest and the South.” The problem with that is that the top tech jobs are in SF, Seattle, and NYC. Students competing for top jobs are not going to the midwest and south. I believe the Michigan places 1/3 at those 4 firms. There is nowhere you can’t reach from Michigan. I just think that Columbia students are probably placed at higher rates in top positions, and also may be likely to be recruited for other options. Finally, all job at Apple, for example, are not the same. A lot of the people working at the Apple store were CS majors. If the student was imagining being a SWE or a PM, that is a lot different. CS salaries seem to be very sensitive to technical skills and I think Columbia pushes students harder to learn more, and starts with stronger students who probably had more CS experience to start. Additionally, it is likely that Columbia students are more likely to have internships and job opportunities at companies right in NYC, where Google owns an entire building, Bloomberg hires many, IBM, Palantir, Jane Street etc. There are also certain positions where a Columbia student would seem to have an advantage of getting included as a candidate. I was talking to a current CS candidate who had a second round tech interview in NYC last week. The person said that there were 6 candidates being interviewed that day, and they were from MIT, Penn, Princeton, Berkeley, and Duke. That has a strong appearance of being a position where the name of the school matters. I do think a Michigan grad can get into that group, but I suspect it would be easier for a Columbia grad. They are both strong brands, but the Columbia brand is very strong in NYC. I am not saying that Columbia is a clear choice, I just think that it depends on where the student wants to end up. If they want to be in the midwest, I would lean toward Michigan. If they want to be on the east coast, I would lean toward Columbia. If they want to be in Seattle or SF, I think it depends on what the student values.  ```\\n',\n",

Feeder school data from M7 business schools suggests as such. High GPA and research experience at UMCP --&gt; pretty good  for PhD programs in computer engineering. I don’t think law schools place that much emphasis on undergrad school, though I am not particularly knowledgeable in this area. If he wants to go for a PhD program in computer engineering, money won’t be an issue … if a school wants you, it will pay for you to attend. Law and business schools are a different matter. I can see that it is a hard decision. In any case, congratulations to your son on his accomplishments and being in position!  ```\\n',\n",

But UMich is not Alabama St.  I consider UMich to be a Near-Ivy and only a handful of MIT admits would have gotten a full-ride from a Near-Ivy/Ivy-equivalent. Those are incredibly rare and difficult to get (if you don’t count the all-female schools and military academies).  Between them, Rice, Duke, UChicago, Caltech, Oberlin, UMich (for OOS), and UVa (for OOS) probably offer fewer than 200 full-rides total.  ```\\n',\n",

I don’t mean to hijack the conversation, but may I ask, if you know, what the financial aid situation is like when a student does the 3-2 program?  Is the tuition and financial aid decision made at the engineering school, or is it Hamilton rates and financial aid for the whole 5 years?  I ask because I believe my son would be eligible for much more aid at one of the schools in the program, but I would like to see him get the writing/communications enrichment that Hamilton offers.  Unfortunately, though, I think Hamilton is going to be unaffordable for us - definitely would be at 5 years.  ```\\n',\n",

That is why it is not interested in playing the rankings game.  The rankings game is all about attracting a lot of applicants who - deep down – are more concerned with prestige than anything else. U. of Chicago was one of the most intellectual colleges back when it had 30% and higher admissions rates.  Students didn’t apply there because of prestige – they applied there because they wanted that kind of education. Chasing prestige is fine and understandable.  But it isn’t something that intellectual colleges care about.  ```\\n',\n",

I’ll add that to say Middlebury has the most serious outdoor kids of the three schools makes little sense based on my observations.  I know that my son chose Bowdoin, in part, because of it’s tremendous Outing Club and the school’s emphasis on exploring nature.  It transformed his life.  Today he teaches, and lives, the outdoor adventure world (along with his day job of teaching biology) as do many of his Bowdoin friends now scattered about the planet combining education with the outdoors.  I’ve no doubt Middlebury is similar, and have less connection with Bates.  You’re correct in suggesting that Bowdoin is unique in it’s balance for those who may not be interested in the outdoors…It’s a school set in beautiful Brunswick and attracts a wide range of students from all cultures.  ```\\n',\n",

I’m very curious as to what they’re basing it on, but not curious enough to ask TBH.  If someone else did, I’d love to read the answer though - or see the statement taken down.

Yes, my son is a swimmer at Williams and loves it. Of the NESCAC schools we visited, I liked all of them – Williams, Amherst, Middlebury, and Bowdoin. The coaches were terrific at each school. We really liked Swarthmore, too, and the new coach there, Karin Colby, was terrific. But we shied away from Swarthmore for the same reason you mentioned – the academic environment seemed a bit intense. Of course, Williams and Amherst are pretty intense, too, but Swarthmore does have a special reputation in that regard. My sense is that Harvey Mudd shares that reputation. It sounds like you’ve gotten the assurances you need at HM – that your odds of admission are very good. But, as for Engineering, my own personal experience is that there is no undergraduate major more intense. Those who choose that major learn a lot, get a strong degree, and find work. But they don’t have much fun in college. If you’re shying away from Swarthmore because of its academic intensity, then I’d suggest you keep in mind that an Engineering major at HM would be VERY intense – probably much more than most students at Swarthmore experience. Pre-med at Amherst would be intense but manageable. Of course, I’m just “some guy” with an opinion, but I’d encourage you to give this Engineering some additional thought. I’ve had a dozen or more friends who attempted Engineering in college quickly move on to something else. Even our valedictorian was pulling very low grades at Notre Dame while attempting Engineering – moved on to something else after the first year and found success. And if you ran into trouble with Engineering at Harvey Mudd, I’m not sure what your other options would be. One last plug – the NESCAC appears to be a terrific place to swim. And Amherst is a great college town, among the best in the US. If you do apply to Amherst, there’s no harm in reaching out to Rueppel and asking if he would support you for EDII. As for whether to attend a top school for med school, you’ll get lots of opinions here on CC. Some suggest that it doesn’t matter AT ALL where you go – so long as you have the GPA and the MCAT scores. My sense is that these elite LACs are great places to go pre-med. And if you succeed, you’ll have your pick of top medical schools. And if you don’t succeed – or simply change your major as a great many do – you’ll still graduate from one of the top colleges in the country (with a terrific education), and you’ll have wonderful options going forward.  ```\\n',\n",

Nonetheless, I’d probably still go with the full ride from Michigan and MIT for grad school. \"\"The biggest issues that I might consider in the public vs private (school) analysis would be class sizes, professor-student interaction, and availability of opportunities outside of the classroom. This would include access to professors beyond posted office hours, availability of special programs, access to research opportunities, unique study abroad programs, funding for special programs/personal student projects/student clubs. Then try to evaluate how much you would take advantage of these special programs at the more expensive school — how “necessary” vs “that would be kind of nice but no big deal” are they to you? Frankly if Baskins Robbins ice cream parlor offers 31 flavors but all you ever order is chocolate — then what difference do the rest of those 30 flavors make to you? They could be the most exotic flavors on the planet, but if all you ever order is chocolate, then so what? MIT’s price tag includes this overwhelming multitude of opportunities — but if all you want is to take a basic set of CS classes (that nearly every good university offers) and get your degree as quickly and expediently as you can — well, why pay for the extras that you’re never going to use? MIT is the ultra deluxe education package deal. Is that what you and your parents want, can afford (preferably without going into debt), and are willing to pay for — because you’re really going to take advantage of all of these incredible opportunities? Okay, so what are some of these extras? For a kid who likes small instead of big, there are freshman learning communities of only 50 freshman and class sizes between 8 - 12 frosh, turning MIT into a STEM version of a LAC.; MISTI (internships all over the world, all expenses paid); IAP (a ton of fun, enriching, and/or educational things to do during the January term); externships (1 month internships during Jan term sponsored by MIT alumni); wanna do research with a professor? Word on the street is that it usually only takes on average 3 emails to snag one!; UROP (undergraduate research program); Super UROP (an extended and beefed up version of UROP); I don’t know the dollar amount but pretty generous funding for the robotics clubs (I’m guessing on the order of maybe $50,000?, but I really don’t know so don’t quote me on this one); ability to test out of required classes; personal one-on-one meetings with your advisor prior to registration every single semester; both general advisors for freshman who haven’t declared yet and major-specific advisors later on; rarely a problem getting classes in your major (although ironically you might have trouble getting less essential classes like PE, glass blowing and toy design); no problems graduating in 4 years (or at least not due to impacted majors anyway); able to take upper division classes and grad classes at will, even as a freshman; prerequisites that are “guidelines” not requirements; athletic coaches that get the fact that your course load is hard and that you’re at MIT to be a student first and an athlete second; a ton of extracurriculars and clubs (although I suspect that most public schools also have this), M.Eng. program (get your Masters in Engineering in only 1 extra year instead of 2, offered only to MIT undergrads), taking classes with professors who wrote (or are writing anew) the textbook; phenomenal, out-of-this-world research going on in the labs; tons of support (free tutoring, mental health counseling, etc.); funding for dorm activities, outings, trips to help dorm bonding; a resident professor living in every dorm and a grad stud on every floor; and, last but by no means least, the amazingness of your fellow classmates, roommates, frat mates. I could go on and on….but my hand is tired of keyboarding now. Hopefully you get the picture. Sorry for the novel. TL,DR — It’s MIT, welcome to the firehose, baby!\"\"  ```\\n',\n",

Does UMD have any supplemental essays or honors essays?   for one of the scholarships (not Banneker Key), the website says they will consider following “academic achievement, extracurricular activities, awards, honors, and an essay.” https://admissions.umd.edu/finance/freshman-merit-scholarships   can you please let me know how to find that essay topic for this scholarship?  D wrote her coalition app essay. but we are unsure how to determine the strength of the essay. Any tips how to figure out if it is a strong essay?  ```\\n',\n",

OK, but semesterly? If everything goes smoothly for your child, then yes, it works out. But what if it doesn’t? 3.75 means the student would have to pull an average of slightly above A- in all his/her classes. What if the student has a rough semester? Gets ill? Somehow mismanages an exam and does more poorly than expected? Then that guarantee goes away, and you’re stuck paying more money. Yale at that low EFC is a great price and has more flexibility.  ```\\n',\n",

I have a kid at an Ivy in a different sport. From California as well and wanted a different culture.  It’s working out ok for him there and the deciding factor was the major, school culture, the team competitiveness and team culture. One thing to seriously consider is the weather especially given that yours is an outdoor sport. My kid would compete in 30-40 degree weather and that was in the spring. Not ideal but it is what it is. The other factor (which may or may not be important to you) is the racial mix of the student body. You mention you had unforgettable feelings about being on princeton’s campus which is great but you bring up a good point that you’re a teenager and might not trust your feelings. You may have that feeling now but there’s always a honeymoon period then reality sets in once practice and school starts and the grind becomes that…a grind. Your teammmates will really shape your experience during your undergrad much more than anything else. I’d give the nod to Stanford: prestige, high quality academics, weather and PAC-12 athletics.  Good luck! P.S. Now that my kid has had some experience as an Ivy athlete coming from another coast, the  drawback has been distance. The lack of family support at meets was evident and the struggle was real. I’m sure it’s contributed to some positive takeaways such as character building but I have to agree with @TooOld4School  ```\\n',\n",

As new fields develop, they split off from the more established departments. Physics gave birth to EE, and EE had to fight for it.  ME is responsible for a lot of the development in BM, but so are ChE, EE and the life sciences. As these field continue to develop, the interdisciplinary nature of BME becomes more complex and apparent. Sometimes the parents don’t like to see the children leave home. They don’t like the loss of control of their offspring and they don’t like the competition for resources within the institution. This result is the fruit of academic politics, but programs do differ. This is another step in the ongoing evolution of engineering/science. Learn about the siblings.  I believe JHU covers the interdisciplinary range of BME.  I am not sure here, but I believe GT is more into the robotics side of BME.  Check with GT.  ```\\n',\n",

Is that major grade deflation?  Is Cornell’s “nowhere near that bad”?  Where do you pull this stuff. As for prestige, I would argue JHU over both (I chose Hopkins over Cornell but did not apply to Dartmouth). But that is subjective as well.  ```\\n',\n",

Also how are you so sure that Hopkins does not engage in student profile refinement as you call it? Every schools does that, but still this can only go so far. You cannot predict what choices an RD applicant will have and you cannot predict which applicants will for sure choose your school of admitted. Chicago’s yield has increased because it has managed to maintain a top 10 USNews spot for quite some time now, it is generally high ranked, and has revamped its undergrad to attract a wider audience. Still Chicago is a more niche place relative to the ivies so it tends to be a bit more self-selected.  RD yield is not at all as easily manipulated as you make it to be. Why is Parchment garbage? It is not 100% accurate but they jut track revealed preference. there are no 100% accurate verifiable sources for these sort of things anyway. The difference is RD yield between Hopkins and Cornell/Brown, the other Ivies is not due to the fact that these schools have some amazing yield protection techniques that somehow Hopkins doesn’t use.  ```\\n',\n",

If you’re paying sticker price, then UofM would make more sense if you’re considering the technical skills you’ll learn as a CS major. Also, do you want to stay in Michigan long-term? If so, Mich places more of their graduates instate than Columbia would. Columbia, however, will give you better OCR opportunities in San Fran/NYC and an, arguably, stronger lifelong network. Also, agreed with @fivesages that Columbia gives you alternate paths if your career plans change–consulting, banking, etc.  ```\\n',\n",

It is a red flag for me to see these posts with “I have high stats from achieving well in high school, but I just want ease and am concerned about rigor” because what you said is right, confidence is important, and I have seen it plus great work ethic and willingness to really think take many students a long way at even these very selective schools like Emory and Rochester. Weirdly enough, it often didn’t even matter what their stats were relative to their “competition” unless they were extremely low versus it.  if they were remotely in ballpark and had developed good study habits, confidence, and a great attitude towards learning, many of these students (that I mentored) would perform well in what are considered hard renditions of courses.  And interestingly, there is a hierarchy (I explained this in another thread at Emory) where you have some key STEM professors that are known to be more intellectually challenging than average for both Emory or elite schools in general, yet they have garnered popular support (there are still students who avoid them, but usually they teach a slight majority of students when other sections are offered) among students because not only do they demand development very high analytical skills (assuming most students, especially younger ones don’t have it), but because they teach the material in a very effective and engaging way, and are also very effective mentors of students no matter how large their section size is. Getting at least a B range grade in many of these professors’ courses really means you learned at a high level and usually these instructors will write really strong recommendation letters for students who scored in that range that showed themselves developing well during the course (and even better ones for students they managed to keep up with after the class).  In same cases, that range of students may even be selected as TAs (A students are not always the only ones who are enthusiastic, and we all know some don’t know how to teach or collaborate with students effectively).

In addition, Emory from what my friends and mentees who did it right told me from their experience, were very well prepped for those more research focused medical schools and MDPhD programs because so much of the life sciences curriculum (including biology which is notorious at most schools for being mostly about memorization throughout the whole thing) has migrated to a focus on research techniques, experimental design, data analysis, and just thinking like a scientist (so many of the most standard biology classes may require students to discuss and present primary literature in whatever field.  It is the best idea ever IMHO.  Even many sophomore level courses have it.  It sends the message that the field nor course are just about “the facts” and also holds students accountable for the foundation they supposedly gained in intro. biology courses, because chances are if you forgot most things or got poor training, reading the literature is all the more challenging because it assumes readers know about a threshold of ideas and techniques already), things that help folks do well on the MCAT and ease transition into research labs.  In addition, students are much more likely to retain the material if it is put in context of real research and real life scenarios as opposed to it being a bunch of facts and details thrown at students for them to remember and regurgitate back. We all know medical schools want a strong GPA, but I think it is important for incoming prospies to think about how they can achieve it (and no it need not be a 3.8 in most cases, as nice as that would be) without having to actively lower their exposure to the right type of rigor.  There is no point in completely compromising your learning outcomes and skill development for looking good on paper for medical schools.

Most people don’t go to a strong 4 year college with the goal of becoming a Starbucks barista upon graduation. That said, you won’t likely start your first job as president of a company. IMO, don’t major in”what will make you a lot of money”,  study what YOU want, what will make you thrive in college, do well and be interesting to employers. Even if you decided to  do Teach for America for a year or so after college, you may choose to go to grad school, a professional school, or move on to a job where your experience will help get a foot in the door.

I believe the answer is maybe in very few scenarios such as for investment banking and consulting and by firms such as Goldman Sachs and McKinsey which target a few schools for recruiting. A nd maybe one can argue that Stanford’s proximity to Silicon Valley’s ecosystem would confer some advantage for graduates interested in tech start-ups. Yes, high tech firms recruit all over the country, but the informal ways to connect with venture capitalists, founders, etc. is undeniably richer in Silicon Valley. Also, in some rare situations where the employer is a foreign country-backed (particularly China) organization looking for employees with internationally prestigious education credentials, Harvard and Stanford would offer an advantage by virtue of their reputation internationally. These are all very rare situations. For the majority of career fields, no there would not be meaningful difference.  ```\\n',\n",

We used to live in the Midwest and had also toured WashU. Both are wonderful schools and you are fortunate to have such great choices. Bowdoin is small, and was smaller than my S’s high school, but my S loved it there and made great friends he still keeps in contact with and gets together with. The town of Brunswick isn’t what I would call “rural” but is a nice little college town. There is a train station and it’s easy to get to Boston. As far as transportation, the closest airport is Portland. When my S was coming back from breaks, he usually found other Bowdoin students to share a taxi with. Since he graduated, there’s a new Metro Bus that connects Portland to Brunswick. St. Louis is obviously a different kind of place - the metro area is over 2 million. You can take the light rail commuter train from the airport to the campus. The WashU campus is very nice. Both schools rank very highly for campus food. Two of my S’s former roommates are in graduate school at UCLA and Harvard, so if your future plan is graduate school, I think either place would prepare you well. I think the decision comes down to: would you prefer a small town in the northeast, or a larger city in the Midwest?  ```\\n',\n",

As previously discussed, many scholarships (if not most) at many schools mandate that the recipient maintain a minimum GPA. Frequently, those conditions are imposed by the benefactor or funder of the scholarship. If the minimum GPA is not maintained, many will reduce or withdraw the scholarship. That is quite a common condition. The vast majority I am certain will state this or any other conditions that must be satisfied up front, and in those cases the student is made aware of his/her responsibilities up front. In my experience most schools are not in the business of “bait and switch”.  ```\\n',\n",

Assuming you plan on majoring in a STEM field, small differences in quality elsewhere might affect your electives but your major studies will be top-notch. Is there a notable difference in cost?

A colleague of mine was a UC Berkeley grad about 25+ years ago and was in the PhD program at Duke.  He never felt comfortable with the surrounding areas.  He said at that time, there were quite a few hillbillies around the Duke campus area and felt uneasy. Eventually, he dropped out of the PhD program.  But that was 25+ years ago and maybe things have changed since then.  ```\\n',\n",

That’s a CMU education or a UMD education and $3,000,000 when he turns 58. That’s the true difference when you consider the opportunity cost of the money ($270,000 at 6% annually for 40 years). Alternatively, it’s $1,500,000 at age 48. It would be a nice bridge between an early retirement and his fully funded 401k at 59.5. He might get a slightly better experience at CMU, maybe even a superior experience. What he won’t get though is an experience that’s even remotely close to $270,000 more valuable financially. You all have to decide if you are flush enough to provide that as a gift simply based on the experience. It’s unfortunately too late for this option now for you, but we had a plan for just this case. Not believing ANY undergraduate degree from ANY school is worth a quarter of a million dollars, we simply told our son that any program that netted out over $200k was off the table. The only schools he applied to, in addition to meeting all the requirements that he wanted out of a school, were schools that had reputations of granting good merit aid to high stats students. Tough choice, but the financial implications are real.  ```\\n',\n",

We live in the Boston area and have searched for engineering schools with our 2 oldest children.  They both started their search investigating broad areas of concentration (biomedical and robotics engineering).  Their engineering parents held back our opinions but steered both to the conclusion that they needed to choose a traditional engineering discipline (mechanical, chemical, civil, electrical) and choosing an industry should be saved for a concentration or master’s/PHD program.  Four years of depth; not just breath.   That process worked well; one chose Chemical and Biomolecular and the second Mechanical. We all learned that both children needed to be in an environment that feeds their interests.  In the case of the ChemE, a campus with a medical school researching in partnership with the ChemE department and a strong Biomedical program.  In the case of the ME, an incredible robotics department, a robust ECE department (there are not may of these and GT is on top), flexibility to add not just CS but EE coursework to an ME curriculum, creating a concentration in systems.  For your interests, GT has it all with many research facilities.  My husband has been hiring for 20+ years.  His managers interview MIT, WPI, Cornell,GT students; it’s really about the candidate not the particular school.  Our freshman is returning to New England to work in Pharma this summer.  Landing internships from afar can easily happen if you get research experience in college and actively pursue summer opportunities. Olin will be diverse but likely in the eclectic way that MA suburban charter high schools attract a type of student.  If that is not your type of happy home for 4 years, take the leap to Atlanta.  I understand the anxiety especially since most MA students do not leave New England because there are so many private schools.  The distance may be greater, but Atlanta, Baltimore & Philly have easier access to home than a drive to Ithica or Rochester in the middle of the winter.  ```\\n',\n",

We live even closer…15 miles and if my son decides to attend, I’d want him on campus. However, my biggest fear is that it will be deserted on weekends, he won’t have that true ‘college’ experience, and as he puts it, he’ll feel like it’s an extension of high school. In two weeks we are having second looks at some other schools he had been accepted at and hope he sees the benefits of those programs as well.  ```\\n',\n",

[/quote]  . Wrong. If this were true, then UCLA or UCSD would be more rigorous than MIT and Berkeley! Stanford doesn’t cram semester long 15 week courses into 10 week stress filled classes. Typical 3 or 2 class sequence such as intro math (51/52/53) is equivalent to a two semester sequence at Berkeley or MIT. For non sequence classes, the material covered at Stanford is much less than the equivalent one at MIT/Berkeley.  ```\\n',\n",

From this reader’s perspective: You seek the school with the least rigorous coursework, graded in the most student-friendly manner, and with highest acceptance rates at medical schools. Is that an accurate summary? Extending that: how successful would such an over-promoted and undereducated student be on the MCATs, at medical school, or as a doctor? Would you trust your child’s health to such a doctor? Just a thought experiment. I’d think the strategic goal of your education would include best preparing you to take on the profession you are considering. If you know the type of medical work you want to do, that may help guide your decision based on the specific opportunities provided at different schools. That’s a far better approach. Nobody asks their oncologist for their sophomore grades, they ask them for answers.  ```\\n',\n",

[/quote]  Not sure why that would be a Stevens-specific issue.  Any scholarship at any college that requires a high college GPA to renew could have this issue.  Obviously, how big of an issue depends on the GPA.  For top-end scholarships that require a 3.0, it is likely that few students lose them (after all, they had to have been at the top-end of the entering class to get the top-end scholarships).  But if the GPA minimum is something like 3.5, that can be more of an issue, since students have to protect their GPAs like pre-meds do.  ```\\n',\n",

That said, I would ask in the Bowdoin forum, or simply google “top restaurants in Brunswick, ME” and check out what the town offers. Off the top of my head:  St. Louis will have better ribs. It is also known for pizza, but good pizza can be found in many environs. Brunswick will have fresh lobster, lobster rolls, seafood in general. I’m not much of a fan of seafood, but I loved the lobster rolls in Maine. It’s like a lighter/flakier, richer version of chicken salad.   ```\\n',\n",

Honestly and politely  I am not sure how much more needs to be said.  2.2 million students per year in US plus thousands of international student apply to us schools each year.  If there are 40k spots in the top 25 for the US portion of the pool  that’s means only the top 18 percent get in. And now take out legacies athletes and urm it’s even a smaller pool. USC is in that pool. The other big names definitely rank higher and have higher prestige among the people in the pool with them. But very few people care but the other people in the pool with you. USC is 70k per year times four years. They are giving you a free house. He has earned the great reward. Enjoy it.  ```\\n',\n",

For techies, not so much, among new hires at FANG, SJSU beats MIT and U of Phoenix beats Harvard.  Economics/business (OP son’s intended study), at undergrad level, is probably more fuzzy than techie. This question of Stanford/Harvard(full pay) vs USC(or similar schools) full tuition merit is asked multiple times every year on CC. Though the opinion seems to be 10 to 1 in favor of merit I have yet to see a taker of that option.  ```\\n',\n",

Rice is also in the nicest part of Houston proper. As for prestige, I think it depends on who (and where) you ask.  There is no question that while both schools’ reputations have increased dramatically over the last 30 years, I’d say that Rice’s has improved more on a relative basis, especially in the South and West of the country. Congrats - you really can’t go wrong with either, but I think I’d lean Rice for most fields of interest.  ```\\n',\n",

Contrast that with out of state public school costs or what I call the “Stevens Dilemma” where a school like Stevens gives huge scholarship discounts to freshmen who fail to pull a 3.0 and thereafter lose that mo ru.  ```\\n',\n",

We live in Ohio and most of the students at her high school chose to attend OSU, OhioU, Miami U or Dayton. The drinking/party culture at those schools did not appeal to her and she was looking for a very different college experience. Vasser, Grinnell, Carleton were all on her list— she was looking for many of the same things the OP noted. I will tell you so far, she has nothing but excellent things to say about Kenyon— she absolutely loves it. She says there are plenty of things to do on the weekend besides go to parties… often times so many different things that she has to choose one over the other when she’d like to do both. And in addition, my introverted kid says she actually enjoys going to the parties on campus… they are fun, “people actually dance” lol her words, and sometimes she chooses to have a beer and other times not. No one cares either way. She’s an athlete and enjoys hanging out with the team, but also has other friends she goes out with as well. She is busy all the time… I wish she’d call more! We are extremely close so it’s an adjustment not hearing from her every day but I am so thankful she is loving Kenyon as much as she is and is not homesick (yet at least!) I know it’s still early, but I honestly didn’t think the adjustment to college would be so smooth. She says it is an incredibly supportive community and the people there are very down to earth, interesting and like minded when it comes to being serious about genuinely learning new things etc. Interestingly enough tonight when I called she had just come from a mandatory meeting at her dorm (bi monthly I believe) called beer and sex LOL where they talk about drinking responsibly on campus etc. So it seems the administration is not blind to what from my perspective seems like “average” college drinking… but then I’m comparing it to what I know about schools like Dayton and OU… where drinking is pretty much the only weekend activity available. Just the perspective of one student… but this was a thread I would have stalked like a hawk a year ago when we were looking, and I am so glad she made the decision to attend Kenyon— So much so my middle child is considering it after seeing how happy her big sis is.  ```\\n',\n",

We also understand how long we have to work to save up $260K after tax and what that type of money really means (roughly $2M by retirement, given conservative return assumptions).  Also, employers will read resumes and know if he got one of those special named scholarships at UMich (he would certainly be free to state that he got the full ride to UMich and note how rare that is on is resume). As you may have guessed, I actually consider that to be more impressive than a mere HYPSM degree. Note that lay people don’t hire.  Hiring managers hire.  ```\\n',\n",

Even so, I’d suggest that the limits are there for a reason. Somebody’s analysis leads to the conclusion that &gt; $31K is not advisable.  FWIW, Yale’s average debt at graduation is about $14K (for students who have any loans, that is, not for all students). So, by both those standards, $60K is a lot (especially if you’re serious about med school, and if $60K represents only part of a much bigger cost difference).  ```\\n',\n",

With curriculum on-line for most school programs and things like “rate my professor” and tons other social media, kids that have a good idea of what they want to study can often plot out 50% or more of the courses they are going to take, even going so far as IDing some of the profs they’d like to study with, or alternatively IDing the profs they want to avoid (One of my kids, for instance, was really insterested in a fairly specific minor where 50% of the required courses are taught by the same prof. I made them email a bunch of current students to make sure the teacher was someone they wanted to spend 6 courses with.)  ```\\n',\n",

They’ve admitted students this current admission cycle to the main University Park campus with substantially lower stats than a lot of business and engineering pre-majors with higher stats.

Also I am not sure about the learning environment of both schools since I have not physically visited the school.\"\" I recommend that you contact Penn admissions and schedule an appointment with a counselor either by telephone or in person. Just call the main number (215) 898–7507, and ask for admissions. Once you get to admissions tell the person you have been admitted, and that you have some questions and would like to speak with a counselor. Talk with the counselor about your concern about grades in pre-med. Ask about what a sample schedule would look like. Ask about research opportunities (Basically any student can get involved in research). Ask about opportunities for pre-meds to get involved in clubs. Ask about opportunities to get guidance about issues like what med school applicants need besides a GPA and an MCAT score. Tell them about your other acceptance too. Let them help you. You should go to Quaker days too, but begin getting more information right away. Knowing more will help you make a better decision. Also, consider the fact that most pre-meds at any college decide not to stay in pre-med. None of those students think it will be them switching out. If that happens to you, you are better off at Penn.  ```\\n',\n",

Normally VT and Penn St are pretty darn equal in caliber (albeit a general edge toward VT in most areas of engineering), but I’d wonder how the switch from the branch campus would go.  The better students from our high school (heading toward engineering) go straight to main campus.  I’m not sure if those who start at branch campuses end up doing fine or if not.  Those I know personally (who start at branch campuses) aren’t engineering majors.  Can Erie’s branch campus let you know how many start out vs finish?  (Then allow for the fact that there will be those who start and don’t finish at the Main Campus too, of course.)  ```\\n',\n",

If you’re interested in participating in research, Pomona will provide extraordinary opportunities, and you will be able to work directly with faculty. You might take a look at the faculty bios in your departments of interest to see what you think of the people you’ll be interacting with. If you’re an ideas person who likes to ask and answer questions and be challenged to develop your own theories, Pomona is a good fit. If you feel comfortable with, and are invigorated by the idea of developing a personal rapport with esteemed faculty, Pomona is a good fit. I still visit with my favorite faculty mentor over 20 years later. The cross-registration is indeed a cool feature of the Claremonts. Each school does have its personality and reputation behind it, but all the schools are strong, selective, and well-resourced, so it’s a powerhouse there. There’s one central main library for all the schools, one campus ministry center, one student health/counseling center, one main bookstore, one student newspaper. Have you visited Claremont? It’s very suburban and not particularly stimulating. You can easily walk to the adjacent “Village” which has a movie theater, coffee shops, and restaurants, and it’s cute and pleasant but nothing that’s really going to ignite any curiosity or provide a lot of opportunities. The surrounding suburbs are even more ho-hum. So there’s really nothing particularly advantageous about the environs there other than it’s a convenient climate that doesn’t impact your life much except for some days in the fall when you will wish you had air conditioning. But if you don’t love Baltimore, then that’s not a real factor I suppose. In my era, Pomona was relatively weak on career development and tended to send many students to either graduate school for PhDs/academia or med school, and the main supported direct placement into full-time jobs was the management consulting route. There were pockets of weak departments and some use of questionable part-time faculty for classes like calculus – but that’s old data so not worth much. All the Claremont schools talk about internship opportunities but be aware that “Los Angeles” is a solid hour by train from Claremont, so this resource has some challenges built in. Pomona places a strong emphasis on diversity and most of the community there are students of color. In that, it feels very similar to southern California as a whole, where there’s no one racial majority. It’s the most selective liberal arts college in the nation with a huge endowment. Still, most everyday people on the street will not have heard of it, so if you want that nod of recognition when making small talk, Pomona isn’t the one. Having said all these things, I’d choose Pomona again based primarily on one key principle: it’s devoted to undergraduates. I think it makes sense to attend the school that is all about undergrads when an undergrad, then attend a grad school where grad students are a priority. In all, you’re in a great and enviable position – congratulations and good luck!  ```\\n',\n",

[/quote]  That would be my kid who stated exactly that reason for preferring an open curriculum.  But lo and behold, she’s taken a writing class and a couple of humanities courses and in one case encountered a favorite professor. She is a STEM major in a small department and so far that means she gets a lot of attention from the dept chair and her professors, help with planning summer research, study abroad plus research connections, and rec letters. I don’t have much to add to the very helpful posts here so far, but will point to a couple of resources you may find helpful. The science center is under construction and is supposed to open fall '18. There are details here: https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/future/greenway-campus/science-center Amherst hosts a SURF program in the following areas (currently, they change year to year): https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/support/funding/students/amherst-student-research-funding-opportunities/summer-research-opportunities-at-amherst/2017-surf-research-areas - it’s paid and comes with housing. They will also provide funding for unpaid internships and research elsewhere. My D also wanted to get out of the midwest, and we also have family in the NE, SO I get where your S is coming from. Carleton sounds like an amazing place too, I can’t see you going wrong here.  ```\\n\",\n",

You might find an easier or tougher Prof at either one of them TBH (or any other school), but both have their reputation due in part to the reputation for their academics and research.  Both schools have students who successfully get into med school each year.  Both schools have those who don’t.  Whether those who don’t could have if they’d made a different choice is debatable. Statistics never apply to the individual. FTR, my pp to you wasn’t meant to be condemnation.  It was meant to get you to seriously look at your presentation, because that matters.  Tact matters in several aspects of life. From those I’ve seen from the high school I work at, the students who are most successful at getting admitted to med school are those who select a school where they are in the Top 25% of incoming students (unless at a lottery school where “all” are really at that level with a point or two here or there being meaningless).  They also have a good work ethic from high school and don’t suddenly arrive at college freshmen year changing their major (or minor) to “party.”  They join things and have fun, but remember to put studying and truly learning the material as their top focus.  They ask questions when they don’t understand something. My theory as to why they do better when they are in the Top 25% (GPA and SAT/ACT) is confidence level.  Those stats tend to show a similar foundation of academics.  Many classes in college start at the “average” level for incoming students.  When students get into a class where they’re “behind” others they tend to feel they are “dumb” compared to the class.  That’s not necessarily true as it’s often a foundation gap they could fill in, but they think it is and get stressed/discouraged.  When they feel “up” with their peers, or on the higher end, it’s a good boost to confidence letting them feel they can continue to take on anything/everything.  It’s a theory (hypothesis if I want to get technical), so take it as you wish.  If you aren’t in the Top 25% for either school, you might want to consider others - or know you could have to work a little bit more at the beginning to close an occasional gap or two in the introductory classes (and that’s ok - you just have to actually do it). Best wishes to you no matter where you ultimately choose.  There’s nothing wrong with wanting a medical career.  You don’t want to give yourself more hurdles by not understanding the whole process.  How you come across at each stage is part of that process.  ```\\n',\n",

With the undergrad degree from Wharton you won’t need the MBA. The total cost of an MBA is ~$170,000. When accounting for the lost wages (assume a decent IB job), then it’s probably around $400,000 after taxes. So NYU + MBA is definitely more expensive, and realistically the Wharton undergrad is more impressive than NYU + MBA in most cases. That said, I would probably just avoid the MBA altogether unless you feel financially comfortable and get into a top program. Penn is also a better school overall, so if you decide finance isn’t for you then you’re better positioned. It’s a tough decision. Good luck either way, I’m sure you’ll fund success regardless.  ```\\n',\n",

This is especially surprising since Vandy places significant emphasis on test scores on the undergraduate level and these kids should score well on the MCAT. The fact that other similarly ranked private schools have more kids enrolled in med school leads me to believe something is off about Vandy’s pre-med program. To spend $200,000 on tuition one would expect a higher placement rate than 66 percent especially since most of Vandy’s pre-med’s would have qualified for AU’s free tuition and 55 percent placement rate.  ```\\n',\n",

My D has decided to go to Carleton (from warm California). She is also interested in STEM and we found Carleton to have one of the strongest programs, among other things. If your son’s goal is to get out of the Midwest, I think discussing your topics is a moot point. Both schools offer equally strong liberals arts education, but they are different in vibe. Another question to ask him though: does he want to live and work on the East Coast right after graduation? If so, Amherst will have more name recognition there than Carleton for recruiting by employers who are clueless about SLACs. On the other hand, Carleton is better known in the Midwest and among friends in our community, here in California (which is the second biggest supplier of Carls after Minnesota). But in the end, both schools have strong reputations and alumni networks, and both are highly regarded by grad schools, if that is your son’s goal. And among employers who know SLACs, both will have equal standing. Responses to your topics, PART 1:  [quote] He plans to study Physics (and go on to grad school). The strength of the Physics department/program is one of the primary considerations. My impression is that Carleton’s Physics program is stronger than Amherst’s. [/quote]  My friends who are physics faculty at top universities (including a college roommate who is a physics professor at Stanford) seem to think Carleton has one of the strongest programs while Amherst is known more for its strength in the humanities & social sciences. This is reflected in the breakdown of students by major too. However, Amherst is an amazing school and I’m sure your son will get a great science education in either school. Incidentally, physics is one of my D’s interests. BTW, did your son get a nice letter from the Carleton physics department chair, Prof. Pattanayak? If he listed Physics as an interest on Common App, he should have.  [quote] The general campus atmosphere: My son prefers an open, collaborative, diverse, somewhat laid-back environment. [/quote]  Amherst is more diverse ethnically. They have recently made a push to recruit URMs, and the very fact that the college president’s quote on diversity was a topic for the Common App writing supplement speaks volumes about their priorities. Carleton is 60% White. However, Carleton tries hard to make their student body as diverse as possible, given that Minnesota doesn’t attract as many minority students, and they love international students. Moreover, our impression is that the students are very respectful of other cultures, open-minded about diverse ideas and customs, and welcoming of diverse students. (We are Asian American.) Diversity can also refer to interests and personalities, and Carleton is definitely diverse in that sense. My wife and daughter attended the International Festival last Saturday while visiting Carleton and saw evidence of this. Plus, they explicitly asked minority students whether they felt uncomfortable there. Except for one African American male, most said that they never felt excluded or uncomfortable. One African American male from L.A. went so far as to say that he has never worried about being profiled or harassed by cops in the Twin Cities or Northfield, which is a far cry from his lifelong experience in diverse Southern California. (St. Olaf, however, is a different story. Read the news to learn what’s happening there. But right-minded students are standing up against hate and protesting against the administration, which has apparently done nothing to combat the racist acts.) Our takeaway from visits and conversations was that Carleton is one of the friendliest, most supportive, and most collaborative colleges out there. And while the academics are intense, they are pretty laid back, or at least they don’t overtly give off a competitive vibe. Amherst seemed more “classic New England competitive” to us, and students didn’t appear as happy on the surface, but I don’t want to generalize based on our experience at one point in time. You’ll find all kinds of students at both schools, and I’m sure your son will find a core group of friends who will make his college years a positive experience. Faculty at both schools are great.  [quote] The kind of students who go there: To give an idea, one thing he really liked about Carleton, in a survey asking students what word they’d use to describe students there, “quirky” was the top choice (at another school, it was “hipster”, which he didn’t care for). [/quote]  PSA: Some past and present Carls are requesting that people get over the “quirky” label.  However, it is true that students at Carleton come from colorful backgrounds, which makes life more interesting. I can tell you that we found the students (and other college community members) to be the friendliest and most down-to-earth of the 30+ colleges we visited. EVERYONE would stop and talk at length about everything we wanted to know, and if they were rushing to class, they would offer to drag my daughter along with them to class, introduce her to professors, and treat her to coffee and lunch afterwards. How cool is that? This is precisely why she fell in love with that place. Our tour guide at Amherst was friendly, but aren’t all of them expected to be? The average student we intercepted to chat seemed to be in a hurry to get away, no matter the time of day. Not a reason to judge an entire school, but we couldn’t help coming away with certain perceptions of the campus culture.  ```\\n',\n",

If you want to choose a school because of campus, honors college, and overall vibe, that’s great. Just remember that when it comes to recruiting opportunities, recruiters won’t give two figs about the campus or vibe and Ross (or other elite majors like CS at UIUC) will be seen as equivalent or superior to many honors colleges. But yes, you don’t have to choose a school to maximum ROI or recruiting opportunities (though that is a uncommon tack for a b-school major, but I digress).

No, but she did debate last year, which was a big time commitment. That’s a good question about balance. She is taking what seemed at first to not be a heavy schedule, including a foreign language and Art. But both classes are very intense, in a good way. She has another class with no tests, but it meets for four hours once a week and there is a lot of writing. 30% of the grade is class participation, which I LOVE because she has to talk (she’s a shy person.) Her fourth class is for her major and is the surpise cool class, which she initially thought would be uninteresting. She hasn’t yet had a single class she didn’t like. As far as social life, she has a very good group of friends and a boyfriend, and they go to campus activities. They take advantage of weekend shuttles to various places in Maine, and some of them drive so they go out in Lewiston, which is in fact a cool little town. They go other places too. She is never bored.  ```\\n',\n",

Lots of good students expect to get admitted to, pick your school, but dont think seriously about 8 or 9 % admission rate.  A medical school with an 8 or 9 % admission rate is a “non selective” school, relatively speaking. George Washington Medical school, for example, had an under 3% admission rate.   And they are picking those 8 or 9 %  or 3% out of a carefully cultivated group of high achieving students.  That is, getting into medical school is just like getting into Ivy League caliber schools and now requires the same resume building stuff for undergraduate but ramped up, research, community service, recommendations.  Telling someone whose dream is medical school to give up the advantage that Yale offers for admission in terms of reputations, personalized attention, and research opportunity to save 60,000 is poor advice, IMHO.  ```\\n',\n",

She says her physics and chem classes were 200 people lectures, math classes 20-50 people, as are most other classes. Engineering was smaller first semester, around 30, now it’s about 50-60. They split up into working groups of 6 people in engineering. There is a one credit course you take if you are in Hypatia that’s a little GPA boost, it is mentoring and career events and 10 hours of community service which was honestly kind of fun for her at the beginning when she didn’t have a lot going on socially. My daughters advice is that if you want better housing or a more social environment, pick O’Shaug or Peddrew-Yates. Pritchard is social but not nicer than Lee. But if you are concerned about work environment for freshman year, the engineering community helps for environmental reasons - no crowds wandering the halls when you are trying to study for a chem test - because they all have the same test. GPAs are higher for engineers in the engineering LLC.  ```\\n',\n",

I know a lot who made more than that and some who made less. If they’re in finance then that seems like an okay estimate. Banks generally pay 140-200k all-in first year. Then it scales up. If you’re in PE it’s higher (250k in third year minimum but some pay up to 400k, and HFs even more). This a path that can be achieved at either Wharton or Stern, but is of course easier at Wharton. I don’t mean to assert that. Lots of Stern kids do very well. Wharton does do better, but is it worth $184,000? I would say no. But I wouldn’t go to Stern just because you plan to get an MBA.  ```\\n',\n",

VT is similar that one gets into their specialty after the core courses unless they’ve changed recently. The setting in Blacksburg is incredible. We loved our time there. It’s only improved since our day. All that said, you could pick based upon finances or where you think you want to live once done and do just fine with degrees from any of your choices. We live in Penn State territory and know a fair number of successful grads from there too. Head down to NC where H is from and there are plenty of NC State grads doing well too.

Maybe stretching up to 400-500 if you become generous at defining what a near-Ivy is. About 7000 matriculants at HYPSM. Most would not have the opportunity of a full-ride at a Near-Ivy/Ivy-equivalent. Many would have the opportunity of partial scholarships or even full-tuition scholarships from good (above the average flagship) schools or full-rides from average flagships or lower. And if this is one of those special scholars programs at UMich, don’t discount the opportunities afforded by those either.  ```\\n',\n",

Obviously Stanford is the most successful Division I athletics in the country and there are some consequences tied to that. There are ‘classes’ for each Varsity sport. Will you be expected to max out the 8 credits available in ATHLETIC 28? Will your Athletic Advisor steer you to easier courses and easier majors so you can focus more on rowing? Is having access to less rigorous courses important because I believe you’ll find more at Stanford than you will at Princeton. All Princeton UGs have to do research and produce a Thesis along with other papers to build up to that. Is that something that appeals to you or not? I think that one thing that is always asked of an Athlete is would you be happy at the school if you were injured and could no longer participate in your sport or if the current coach left?  ```\\n',\n",

The family has strong connection with both CU and Michigan. Children attended thses schools, though not CS, and are doing well. We often have similar discussions at home now that the fourth generation is entering the colleges. I will write what all of you know, but are debating based on personal preferences and bias.  In terms of placement, Michigan is pretty good. CU is equally good,could be better in programs offered in liberal science and arts. The top tech companies, are not so concerned about the Ivy Tag, and will recruit the best irrespective of the brand. Just not Michigan or Berkeley, even UIUC, Georgia Tech, UT Austin are very favourite grounds of the top tech companies. Many of the lead recruiters are not from Ivy League and have firsthand experience of students coming from public or non-ivy private universities. It is true many parents would like to see their children attending Ivy league or top private universities over top public universities. It is based on the value that we attach to a brand that fits into overall public perception. Good students excel any way and the decision of the schools they attend is also based on the cost of attendance and other preferences, be it place, sports, music, culture. My grand nephew preferred Northwestern over Columbia because he felt the Evanston campus will provide him with better college experience that the CU campus. Very personal and I don't think, we can say whether he was right or wrong. Lots of statistics are being dished out. In my opinion, these things are not the core reasons for choosing the place for undergraduate education.    ```\\n\",\n",

You need good cooks, i.e., a quality teaching faculty, to make it happen  In the age of modern marketing, the packaging takes over from the talented cook.  You will never replace talented teachers and they are not always defined as the faculty with the most research. There was a math teacher when I was in college who was so well known that students from other universities would seek him out for his skills as a private tutor.  A family member who was a student at the state university would study calculus with him over the summer.  She graduated as Valedictorian from her University and went on to head the technical division for Region I of the EPA  while producing some fine research.  This talented “cook” came to us by way of  Hamilton College.  He did not have a string of significant publications but always had yet another way of explaining a concept,  Another math faculty educated at Bowdion gave up a few hours on a Sunday afternoon to go over questions I had collected.  Perhaps these small LA colleges have a point! How do you account for these “cooks” when selecting an  undergraduate institution?  This is not reflected in the USNEWS rankings as they are based largely on graduate school research.  ```\\n',\n",

Certain firms & companies feed more employees into M-7 MBA programs than others. So, for a variety of reasons, post undergraduate placement is important. Because of Atlanta’s significance in the business world, great opportunities are available in Georgia. Because of IU-Kelley’s reputation, standards, programs & size, great opportunities are available from IU-Kelley. And, yes, I understand that you are not in the MBA program at either school, but you can benefit from a strong MBA program as an undergraduate business major in a variety of ways.  ```\\n',\n",

Not even considering the full ride.  And their amount of alumni giving is mentioned in the press as astronomical compared to other schools So if I was a football star and was offered a full ride I should say no and play football for Harvard or Stanford and pay them 73k a year after taxes for the privilege of doing so.  Just so I could impress my boss neighbor or someone at s cocktail party If it were revenue neutral I would pick h or s of course.  But this whole conversation is silly. He is smart enough to get s full ride and into h and s. He is smart enough to finish top of his class at usc and go to hbs or hms or Stanford law.

Not all eight semesters are required to be on campus attendance allowing for internships, semester abroad, exchange programs at other schools, etc.  ```\\n',\n",

Some students manage to graduate with both a BS/MS in 4 years at no additional cost.  No GRE test needed as well.  Or you can choose to stay and do a 50% off Masters at JHU in your fifth year - guaranteed and a rare benefit not offered at most schools. if you want a completer picture of the Class of 2017, go on linkedin.  There are several CS grad school students at Stanford from JHU for instance. I worked for consulting at Bain & Co after MIT grad school and am now at Google as a product manager.  I was in the Ph.D. program at MIT but left with a fully funded master’s after I determined I didn’t want to stay another 4 years to complete the doctorate. The factors for getting into a top graduate school with funding are research experience (first author publications help especially) and recommendations by notable professors. You will have no shortage of this at JHU with ample summer funding (see PURA and other funded research programs with JHU professors).  Test scores and GPA are next in importance.  Interviews will come into play as well. I had my selection of funded grad schools (Caltech, Stanford, MIT, Columbia, etc) when I applied.  I didn’t graduate at the top of my class (had about a 3.7 GPA - average at JHU is about a 3.4 now). I started research sophomore year and got published in a few publications as did some of my classmates during junior year.  My professor earned his Ph.D. from Stanford and is a well respected researcher as are most professors at Hopkins. His recommendation sealed the deal as my grad school interviewers knew who he was and held his opinion in high regard.  ```\\n',\n",

The sad fact (with everyone’s facts) is the op was asking about engineering. I am sure he /she is running for cover or left this thread so everyone can compare that their bike is shiner then yours… I wish this thread would end but Feel compelled to state the obvious, Duke is a small Elite Private school that can take the cream of the crop applicants. I don’t think they are taking lower Stat kids like public schools do in general. For engineering their program is very limited. I didn’t even know they had a program but just went on their website. But if I wanted one of the programs they offered I am sure it’s excellent. It’s Duke… They don’t have bad programs. As stated in my previous posts the opportunities at Michigan are ENDLESS. To the Op, Please pm me if you want more information. My son is going into engineering to get into finance /business management. He really likes the way engineering is taught and makes you think at a different level. Again as stated, he is going back to Michigan tomorrow to do a week long leadership Capstone for their $10,000 grant. They will work with mentors also over the summer to come up with a business plan going forward. It's the first time they took a freshman group and Michigan is paying for an airbnb for the 3 of them for the week to be there....... This is how Michigan supports their students endeavors! For those spitting out facts please read my two previous remarks in this thread. This is just one example of reality at Michigan that doesn’t show up in the useless stats that are being stated. If you have the initiative and drive you will be successful at either institution.  ```\\n\",\n",

I would not consider a 3+2 program as a realistic option. Very few students end up doing them, which requires switching colleges after your junior year. I think the focus should be whether you really want to start out as pre-med or in engineering. GA Tech likely is a GPA killer for med school, especially if you are in engineering. But if you want to be an engineer, GA Tech is amazing. If you start out at Hamilton or Wesleyan and decide not to do pre-med, you could get a masters in engineering (with an extra year or two of school elsewhere), though that is sub-optimal compared to just going to GA Tech. Tough decision. If you can visit all of them, that would probably knock one or two of them out.  ```\\n',\n",

Once you step off campus, the surrounding areas  of each college have a tangibly different feel. Delaware County (PA) is nearly four times more densely populated than Henrico County (VA). In fact, compared to Haverford, I’d be tempted to say that Richmond is more rural in feel. But, that, I’m sure, would inspire some pushback from others on this forum. Both are lovely, lovely campuses.  ```\\n',\n",

I’m ex bain from JHU, and can tell you point blank all three “elite” consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain, BCG) hire more than their fair share of JHU students.  I’d also see what division of Goldman is hiring.  Hackathon usually constitutes their IT divisions - far from elite like their IB division which hires substantially from JHU (i’m happy to name JHU alumni that are in Goldman’s IB group from recent classes). Lastly in tech, Google and Facebook and other elite firms also hire substantially from JHU.   I work for one of the former now.  It’s unclear proportionally that they hire more from from Georgia Tech - I certainly don’t see it at HQ. I’d choose JHU, bias and all.  When I graduated, I had my pick of grad schools with a full ride for Ph.D programs and my choice of jobs at graduation as well.  Ended up getting a Master’s for free from MIT, but had McKinsey, Bain, and Google offers at graduation as well.  When I was choosing schools for undergrad, I was also offered a scholarship at Georgia Tech (Stamps) along with UMD (Banneker-Key) and UVa (Jefferson), but ended up paying a bit more at JHU and don’t regret it in the least.  ```\\n',\n",

He is also in charge of the fundraising for the Baja Race Team this year, and will be going with the team to the annual SAE Baja Race event in Kansas this summer.  Last year he also did the Robotic Sail team but dropped it this year as the time commitment for it was too much.  He took a class at Wellesley last semeste.  He seems to be going to Boston or the neighboring area with classmates about every other week or so.  It all depends on the student and what passion he or she has and wants to pursue.  There is nothing at Olin to limit students if they want to truly do something outside of class.  ```\\n',\n",

Admission to Amherst or HM is “questionable” for virtually everyone. The admission rates at those schools are in the mid-to-low teens, and even extraordinarily well prepared students are rejected by the hundreds every year. Additionally, nearly half of the students at these top LACs are varsity athletes. Are you really suggesting that these talented young people can’t handle sports and a pre-med major? Most would find that proposition laughable – my own son among them. Now if you’re talking about DI athletics at the Big Ten or SEC level, then you may have a point. But these are D3 programs that work extraordinarily hard to create an environment where student athletes can flourish. And they do – often while juggling pre-med courses.  ```\\n',\n",

If undecided, then why invest the money at this stage of your life when you can use it for grad school or anything else ? After a few brief communications with you, I encourage you to stay close to home & be with your high school friends & enjoy all that Athens & a rollicking SEC school has to offer. If I thought that you were a bit more formal (for lack of a better word). I would suggest the University of Alabama Honors College or Auburn.  ```\\n',\n",

FYI, and FWIW, in recent years (in voting with their feet) most cross-admits choose Stanford and that would be my choice as well.  The top tier in the US is Harvard-Stanford, and that is not about to change.  Your observation that Stanford “will gain more prestige in the coming years” is dead-on. The arc of Stanford’s trajectory in US academia has been amazing since the 1950’s and shows no sign of diminishing. I have never been sold on the “this school blah blah blah undergraduates, while this school blah blah blah graduates.”  That argument is over-hyped and specious (popular with parents and with those who are not professional academics at the very best schools).  The best scholars are the most passionate about their work and that passion is shared with their students. Again, congrats. Two great schools. Can’t go wrong. Best of luck wherever you go/row,  ```\\n',\n",

With respect to major choices that might be appropriate, you might consider computer science, math, physics, economics, or a combination from this group. In terms of post-graduate earnings potential, early career salaries can be found through U.S. News. Hamilton appears highest among the NESCAC LACs in this area. But, as stated, be sure their curriculum appeals to you based on your sincere academic interests.  ```\\n',\n",

[/quote]  For engineering?  You ought to find a different crowd to consult with.  Powerhouses in engineering are often different than powerhouses for other majors.  Doing a quick google search and just looking on the search page it appears they’re ranked #13.  ASU is #38.  PSU is #24.  Individual departments have their own ranking so one should look at what they are interested in if rankings matter.  As with anything else, different schools have a more directed engineering focus. Overall though, in engineering circles, yes, VT is considered an academic powerhouse.  H has had headhunters after him pretty much his whole engineering career and even when doing projects on other continents, his VT degree was respected (since many of those folks cared about the name on his diploma as well as projects he’d already done).  ```\\n',\n",

Although falling out of favor, typically 40% to 50% of Wharton grads got their MBAs at ages 27 through 29. Hard to believe that those high income earners would give up their positions to return for two years of school, however, unless wanting to change employers and careers, or their careers hit a roadblock due to not having an MBA. Very recently that figure has fallen to 27% of Wharton grads going back to school for MBAs at ages 27 to 29. OP: In short, if $184,000 plus interest means nothing to you, then feel free to go to Wharton. But, if you are going to major in finance, NYU Stern will put you in competition for the same jobs as a Wharton finance major.  ```\\n',\n",

GaTech is more fun loving student body, and less intense workload  than JHU.   Gatech has an excellent collaboration with Emory and a shuttle bus for BME students who want to work with medical doctors. I would choose GaTech over JHU for the social aspects of undergraduate education. Remember a BME undergrad  is going to either get a PhD or go to medical school, so getting plenty more education at least four more years of med school or six more years of research and classes for a PhD. The rank difference is not that big between JHU and GaTech.  GaTech is arguably better for the design aspects of BME, the mechanical engineering side of BME. Systems biology, maybe a bit better at JHU, if you are looking for research work.  GaTech is particularly good at imaging sciences, tissue research, see their materials science and chemical engineering department, and of course anything related to design is superb at GaTech. Engineering overall is better at GaTech compared to JHU if thats your bent as well. Caltech is in a class by itself, with mathematics thats way more advanced, so a student needs to have mastered Calculus 3, and even part of differential equations to be able to earn Bs at Caltech in freshman math.  It starts with Analysis.  Caltech freshman have typically passed a college level physics class and that is assumed knowledge to start beginning required physics at Caltech, required for every major there. GaTech, if you score a 7/7 on IB Physics, you can place out of freshman physics, if you want to and take a more advanced physics class, or repeat as you see fit.  Physics is not the hardest class you will take at GaTech,probably, if you are taking freshman physics. JHU and GaTech are not as challenging (ball busting???)  as Caltech in physics and mathematics.  ```\\n',\n",

You asked if I liked UGA.  Yes, I did love UGA and the accounting program set me up for success, but that was 27 years ago and I am not you. After reading all of the new posts I have to reiterate what I posted earlier.  For accounting there is not an academic difference in these two schools.   Employers have been hiring from these two schools for decades and have been shaping the curriculum for decades, and that gives the programs a trade school like feel.  Rankings matter, but when you drill down to something specific like accounting it’s more about your chances of landing a great first job.  Both schools will be heavily recruited by top accounting/consulting firms. MBAs were mentioned earlier, and I would recommend not considering that.  I would recommend a masters in accounting, and then after a few years out in the real world decide if you want an MBA.  Both schools will allow you to attend an excellent MBA program. What brought me back to this thread was that I had dinner last night with the IU grad mentioned above.  We both agreed that within accounting groups our degrees are respected, but outside of that group it’s just a business degree from a state school.  Both of us loved our time in college and feel like it set us up for success. Good luck in your search!  ```\\n',\n",

I think with most things what you do matters much more than where you go but there are some exceptions. Harvard’s neurosurgery residency program probably won’t seriously consider an applicant who didn’t attend a top medical school. Similarly, some VC firms virtually require their employees to have elite undergraduate degrees. It’s probably also easier to excel as an undergraduate at an elite private school. Self-motivated students who are confident in their ability should definitely consider the state school option if it makes financial sense. Finally, the mediocre (3.4-3.7) Penn student has a much better shot of getting to HBS than the mediocre Alabama student.  ```\\n',\n",

I encourage you as a parent to read: “Report of the Alcohol Task Force Kenyon College March, 2017”. The Alcohol Task Force members include: (10 members) Two Kenyon College Trustees Three then current Kenyon College students Kenyon College Vice-President for Student Affairs Co-Director of College Counseling A Kenyon College Professor of Biology A Kenyon College Professor of Anthropology A Kenyon College Professor of Sociology I will rely on my own visits & on the report of this committee which concludes that Kenyon College needs to continue closely monitoring binge drinking & excessive drinking on campus. P.S. The Kenyon College Alcohol Task Force was founded in September, 2016. This is a bit disturbing considering the tragic occurrences over the past decade or so at Kenyon College. What took so long ?  ```\\n',\n",

Your parents possibly can but I’d thy dont have money now they’re unlikely to have it in four years if they don’t have it now + you said they didn’t want to contribute. External scholarships tend to be small and are often just for one year. The best financial aid comes from the colleges - start rooting around your college and department at Pitt looking for scholarships. As a financial safety, apply to WCU and their honors college. Do apply to PHEAA.  ```\\n',\n",

I wanted to post something on this discussion because I feel that there’s some misinformation being put out here, or at least information that doesn’t jibe with my own experience. I looked at Vassar early on in my college search. It’s a great school, but it felt too much like the private high school I attended in San Francisco. That’s a personal perspective, obviously. My high school teammate is now playing at Vassar and loves it. My final college choices were Oberlin, Carleton, Macalester, Bates and Kenyon. All great schools. Of these, Kenyon felt the most comfortable for me. I’m interested in the humanities (a likely English major) and Kenyon’s offerings in this area seemed to be the strongest of those colleges. I loved the look of Kenyon’s campus, and after 4 years of high school in the middle of San Francisco, I was also attracted to the rural setting of Kenyon. As to the drinking culture at Kenyon, some of what’s being presented on this thread doesn’t ring true to me. Of course, there is drinking at Kenyon. But I have never felt pressured to drink, there are many students who do not drink, and I have rarely seen anyone out of control at a party. In fact, Kenyon students seem especially attuned to the dangers of excessive drinking, and we are all educated about the known linkages between alcohol consumption and other problems like sexual assault. I think Kenyon’s administration does a great job in this regard. As to Kenyon’s Greek scene, I think this may be misunderstood unless you’ve experienced it up close. Kenyon’s Greek organizations are more like community service clubs than traditional fraternities and sororities. Yes, most of the Greek organizations throw parties, but they are open to the whole Kenyon community. Fraternities and sororities at Kenyon don’t live together (generally) and I’ve always found them to be quite inclusive even if you’re not a member. I think they add a lot to the campus social scene. The assertions on this thread that Kenyon has problems with alcohol consumption are untrue in my experience. I’d suggest - respectfully - that unless you go to Kenyon, or are an alum, parent, or employee, then perhaps you don’t have the highest-quality information to report.  ```\\n',\n",

Even amongst the top 5 schools, the actual numbers are pretty tiny (say 50-100 students actively deciding between a couple top 5s). Below the top 5 schools, then, the number of cross-admits going to any other school is really small - like in the single and low double digits. It is amazing - as HYMPS have similar admissions “systems,” out of, say, the 1-2 million people applying to US colleges in any given year, only about 8,000-9,000 are truly in the running at the top 5.  That’s maybe only an eighth of a percent of the applicant pool!  This speaks to: 1.) the selectivity at the tippy top AND 2.) a narrow-mindedness in what the top schools seek.  Dean Shaw, in the Stanford Report, noted that he needs to come up with reasons why a student is accepted at Stanford and not Harvard, and faculty question him on it.  I’m not sure it’s a good thing that all top schools now define “excellence” in the same narrow way.  ```\\n',\n",

So 75% of students will be lower than that. While the 75% percentile is a bit lower for the whole UA student body, the honors and the NMF students that you will be taking classes with will have higher stats than that. You now need a 1480 plus SAT for the Presidential scholarship I think. In NY housing on or off campus will be very pricey. Take the money at UA and take advantage of all the opportunities it awards you. The money your parents save can be used for law school.  ```\\n',\n",

That score translates to a 35 act.  The middle of your 34 to 36 example. If you add in the 34s maybe another 30k. I’ve checked before but it’s not the exact number that matters. Top ten percent of any group is good company. Top five percent even better.  Top two percent. That’s pretty close to rare. That isn’t one in a million but pretty darn exceptional. There aren’t really “scores” of students in the 34 to 36 cohort as many suggest. Only mentioning this as CC threads are filled with this small group of exceptional students and their parents. It can distort the reality of 2.25 million of the 2.3 million potential applicants.  ```\\n',\n",

Amherst will not include loans in your aid package but you can take as much as you want up to the direct loan max, to help with your family or student contribution, for example. D is not an athlete, loves her school, had an active social life that includes athletes and musicians and artists. The ultimate team there was the first one ever, and it is a club sport with two level teams so if he wants to play he can. Study abroad… Main thing to know is cost/financial aid is the same on campus or away. So he can choose whatever. D’s academic experience has not felt competitive to her at all. She makes great use of office hours, reading and quant center, and other students. Sorry I know nothing about the physics Dept.  ```\\n',\n",

I think you are having trouble deciding because none of these three ticks all of your boxes.  I will add it’s not necessary to tick all of the boxes, nor does a college have to be “perfect” for you to have a good experience and meet your goals. Are you interested in biomedical engineering primarily for the career prospects or would a science major available at a LAC suit you just as well? If you are set on engineering, I would pick GA Tech as few people enrolled at LACs actually do 3+2 programs @Chembiodad 's twin daughters are pursuing STEM disciplines at Hamilton.  Maybe he will weigh in here and/or you can check out the Hamilton forum on CC for more information. Wesleyan skews very left politically - if you want to avoid political extremes, you might want to investigate that angle a bit further. It looks like the cost gap has narrowed among your options.  Do you know what your costs are likely to be with your parents’ new salaries?  Did you run the NPCs with the new amount? These are three excellent but different choices.  Good luck with your decision!  ```\\n\",\n",

I would think companies hire based on the specific skills and internship experiences an individual student had, and if their area of interest matches the companies, or maybe the connections the students have made with the companies over the course of his/her work, studies, and projects.  ```\\n',\n",

Undergrad has nothing to do with compensation. In the situation above, where the recent graduate got the $70K per year job: I assume her alternate path would be a lesser paying job, say $40,000 just for discussion. Say both jobs are in California. the 70K job will take home about 52K after federal, state, social sec, medicare, etc. The 40K job will take home will take home about 33K for a difference of 19K per year. Keeping the arithmetic simple 240K divided by 20K is a 12 year payback. But the arithmetic is not that simple. If the 240K were invested it would likely double resulting in a payback of 24 years. And that assumes that a 22 year old would start saving 100% of the difference between the two jobs, the likelihood of which is about zero. So the real time to pay back easily exceeds a quarter century for most people. I am not arguing that making more money is pointless. However, giving up savings and compounding investment returns in exchange for a system of progressive taxation a questionable choice. The same is true on the other end of the workalike calendar. If you are nearing retirement, would you rather have saved more than enough or hope that your final years are the highest paying and maybe you can save the difference realizing that is precisely when companies will wonder about younger, less expensive replacements? I would pick savings. A hard to calculate factor is that compensation arc. For the physician, the slope of the arc is zero. It just doesn’t matter where a person did undergrad. For many other jobs, the Ivy league graduate might have an accelerated compensation arc over a career, mitigating the time for payback of the more expensive education.  ```\\n',\n",

However, the academic intensity is high (regardless of major), and the large core curriculum (including HSA requirements) means that cherry picking courses that you are most likely to get A grades in is more difficult. In contrast, Amherst has no general education requirements, which means that you can cherry pick courses that you are most likely to get A grades in to boost your GPA for pre-med purposes.  But there is no native engineering degree program. You can do pre-med as an engineering major at many schools, but the high volume of non-overlapping requirements for most types of engineering and pre-med course requirements can make it difficult to fit all of the course work into four academic years of normal course loads.  Adding intercollegiate athletic workload makes that even more difficult.  ```\\n',\n",

With plus-minus grades at UA, an A+ being worth 4.33, the top students like you that gets lots of those have an easy time being at or near 4.0.  Every year there are hundreds of President’s List 4.0 grads. The 170 LSAT is not as easy, but not unreasonable.  My brother actually had no intention of law school.  He was getting his MBA, and working at a test prep place to make some money.  He was teaching an LSAT review course.  Decided that if he’s teaching the course, he should take the test for the experience.  He got 175.  Then he said I guess I have to go to law school.  ```\\n',\n",

I didn’t know schools could deteriorate or improve so much tremendously in such a short time frame relative to others.  It is more absurd to treat the Forbes ranking as grounded in any semblance of truth. You can do a comparison of per capita CS alumni using LinkedIn at FANG for Jhu CS versus Pomona CS. It should be a telling insight.  ```\\n',\n",

If you haven’t visited, I would get my skates on and visit before committing to a school ED- the cost of a quick trip will only be a fraction of the cost of a getting there & finding you aren’t happy! @prezbucky’s list is a good summary of ‘usual suspects’! There is a lot of applicant overlap between them. IMO, the crucial thing about these schools, which appeal to so many of the same kids, and which are similar in so many fundamental ways, actually do ‘feel’ very different (as you can see from the above posts). I knew- before my collegekid did- which of these schools she would end up choosing, b/c I saw how she responded to it, viscerally, at re-visit day. She hadn’t even been that keen to go that day- she had already visited the school, done an overnight, sat in on a class, etc, and figured she knew pretty much all she needed to know (plus, it was the last of the re-visits & she was burning out). Her response to the day was just different than to the other schools: it was clear that she felt at home there, in a way that she had not at any of the other, pretty similar, schools. tl;dr: Go with your instincts- where did you feel most at home? Both schools are very campus-centric- that will be home for a long 4 years. Trust yourself.  ```\\n',\n",

Starting pay difference last year was only a difference of less than $12,000. IU-Kelley undergraduate starting pay averaged about $69,300. UGA-Terry undergraduate starting pay averaged about $57,850. Among the 88 undergraduate business schools rated & ranked by P&Q, IU-Kelley had the 11th highest average SAT score, while UGA-Terry had the 45th or 46th highest SAT score average. Internship placement rate at IU-Kelley was 91%, at UGA-Terry it was 85%. A large part of your decision, therefore, should be based on what type of undergraduate college experience you want. IU-Kelley will be business & academic focused. Your new friends will be business students & Hutton Honors College students for the most part. Followed by Business Honors in your second year & thereafter. At UGA you will have the comfort & familiarity of your high school friends & the advantages of being close to home. Business school will come in a year or two. And you will have a substantial sum to put toward graduate school.  ```\\n',\n",

Only thing is that you cannot simply add the math +verbal when given as separate ranges. this is why i rote down verbal and math separately  (I guess i paid attention to my stat class at Wharton after all…) As I said before Cornell has a few schools that attract people with  in general lower SATs. If you took just the liberal arts, business and engineering students (leave out agriculture, hotel etc) then there would not be much of difference. Besides, these differences in scores do not show a difference in academic accomplishment. any of these schools could have an entire class with perfect or new perfect scores.  Just means they are willing to admit non-traditional student that have something special but not top scores. Example: Yale and Chicago have higher scores than Stanford. Does this mean that they admit more accomplished students? of course not. It is just that they focus is slightly different.  ```\\n',\n",

Personally I have a few friends who did pre-med at Hopkins and they felt it was rather brutal. Also they food the physical environment rather stressful. Cornel and Hopkins definitely are more grade deflated and rough than Dartmouth though. The advantage for Hopkins as a pre-med is that you could also get involved in some great research as an undergrad and boost your med school application. As for the prestige point, definitely it is rather subjective, but for undergrad Hopkins has a lower yield rate (40.6%) than both Cornell (52.7%) and Dartmouth (51.4%) and tends to lose the cross admit battle with both. While this is not a perfect measure of prestige, it does reveal desirability to an extent. There is not a big actual different but Cornell and Dartmouth probably benefit because they are ivies.  ```\\n',\n",

As for the techie/fuzzy divide, my D is far less apologetic about her choice of study than the author of that article. She has no “shame… about being a fuzzy” nor “insecurity about pursuing an uncommon path…” She embraces her choices wholeheartedly and is passionate about what she is studying. It is indeed the case that STEM fields reign supreme at many colleges and universities these days. Humanities and the arts often get short shrift in a society where “return on investment” and job placement seem to be among the most important factors in choosing an institute of higher learning. (Most of the posts on this thread concern themselves with this very issue). It is also the case that those who choose to study the humanities at Stanford can have all of the faculty support and resources they need. I see Stanford as ahead of the curve on this – while other schools are scrambling to shore up their STEM programs, Stanford has been investing some real money into its arts and humanities programs over the course of the last decade. Oh, as to the question “What came first, the fuzzy or the techie?” My answer is “Neither.” Back in Leonardo’s day, science and art were not seen in such mutually exclusive terms; he is celebrated as much for his scientific genius as he was for his artistic genius. And, @USCWolverine – just because USC was not a good fit for my D, who happened to be seeking an intellectual vibe, does not mean that there aren’t a great number of highly intellectual students and faculty there and that it isn’t a fabulous school. It just wasn’t the “golden ticket” for my daughter.  ```\\n',\n",

As a doctor, especially if you end up specializing, that 60K plus the cost of med school really wouldn’t be a terrible burden.  You most likely will be able to pay if off a few years into your practice.  But if you intend to go into academic medicine or just do family practice, then financially it might become a bit tight.

Upper classman classes with 600 students! [/quote]  Looks like they let the L&S CS major expand to 550 students per year (despite the minimum 3.3 college GPA in the prerequisites for L&S undeclared students to enter the major), to go along with the 300-400 in EECS (which is tightly regulated at the frosh and transfer admission levels).  L&S CS appears to be the second largest major on the UCB campus (economics is larger), a very different situation from the early-to-mid 2000s when the number of students was under 100 per year in the wake of the tech bubble crash. According to the class schedule, the upper division courses with over 600 students appear to be CS 170 (algorithms) and CS 188 (artificial intelligence).  On the other hand, there does not seem to be much interest in the EE side of EECS, since the upper division EE courses have enrollments under 30.  ```\\n',\n",

Assuming taxes at around 40% then it’s (400-170)/.6 = 383k over two years. That’s actually less than anyone I know made in two year combined after being out of schools for two+ years. So that number could be higher, but sure maybe the MBA is half cost. It’s still much more expensive than the gap between Wharton undergrad and Stern in this case. I fully understand the decision to go with Stern if the financial burden is too high on the family. It just seems silly to say it’s too high but then get an MBA which is even more expensive and generally less impressive than just having gone to Wharton for undergrad.  ```\\n',\n",

It’s probably easier for some kids to do a ton of PSETs and bang out a bunch of lab reports than it is for them to write a 15-page research paper and vice versa. Then there’s the issue of graduation/gen ed requirements and how those can be met, whether or not there is a core curriculum, etc. Also, bear in mind that there are theses and there are theses. One of the things my D looked at in comparing two schools within a consortium were the quality of the senior theses of each of the schools (they were available online through the library). Overall, there was a significant difference in the length and quality of the work from the students at one school versus the other. She also noted differences in the levels of intellectual curiosity among the student bodies that she perceived inside and outside of the classroom among the many schools she visited. Overall, you are probably correct about rigor floors and ceilings…the college experience (and life) is often what you make of it; it can be as banal or as rich as the person living it.  ```\\n',\n",

[/quote]  This is what I’m disagreeing with, if for nothing else, because Olin is in Boston’s back yard. I disagree more so because of the previous qualifying sentence that Olin is a hands on program while GT is a “world class research institution.” No doubt the latter is true, but the question is…what does that have to do with the undergraduate learning experience? Olin is a direct response to large, yes very successful, research institutions, that don’t put the maximum priority on undergraduate education to produce practicing engineers. The great research schools like Caltech, Berkeley, Stanford, etc. are also known to have very large classes, lots of TA instruction and a lack of principle application. Can they produce good bachelors level engineers? Sure. Does their status as a research institution help that? I’d argue that it’s a hindrance.  ```\\n',\n",

Rutgers didn’t give a dime of aid to us. I understand what my son means by having a feeling that Rutgers would be ‘an extension of high school’. That came from him, not me. I grew up near SUNY Stony Brook and was strongly advised by my HS guidance counselor to look at other schools outside the area upstate public and private. For me, it was the best move. Everyone is different. But when a school shows interest and is offering significant aid, how Do you not look further into it.  ```\\n',\n",

Being from New Jersey I knew North Eastern, always got them confused. Rice I was always vaguely aware of because of its connection to NASA and to Kennedy and to science in general. I know that’s just me but I am not that unique. I just went through two rounds of college for my kids neither had northwestern anywhere on their radar and I don’t think anyone from their high school applied and HS sent multiple kids to the ivies every year. A good friend of my daughter got a full ride at NorthEastern and other kids applied there.Anyway I think Northwestern is even more known mainly in its region then Rice.  ```\\n',\n",

Having a lad in med school and seeing the work required there to do well becoming a doctor anyone would want to see, if you’re worried about the rigor in undergrad classes you’re probably best finding a different career plan. Taking what is perceived to be the “easy” route (according to the candidate) is one med school admissions frowns upon (as told to us by med school admissions reviewers when the above mentioned lad was contemplating pre-med), so you might want to consider rewording questions, etc. Your best odds at getting into med school come from your putting in the effort studying to get good grades and an MCAT score while simultaneously getting the experiences needed within the medical field. I’ve seen students do this from many different schools - small religious LACs to large state schools and anything in between.  The common denominator is they worked to do it (and had the ability to do it), not which school they went to.  Their applications were attractive due to their accomplishments - not due to anyone freely giving them something. I see very little difference between Emory and U Roc as destinations for undergrad.  What you do at either will be the tipping point.  Definitely consider finances as med school is expensive.  Definitely consider what you “like” because students often do better where they are happier.  Consider what your Plan B is too.  Every potential med school candidate should have one as many do not make it in.  That’s just the way it is.  ```\\n',\n",

[/quote]  I’m sure that this is true. However, I also think that there are significantly more “science-phobes” and “math-phobes” out there than “social science-phobes” or “humanities-phobes”. Amherst’s own data bear this out. The following numbers are from the Amherst Class of 2011, and were compiled for a 2013 accreditation review. For comparison, let’s use “3+ classes per academic division” as a benchmark, because it is a common LAC distribution requirement (as at, for example, Williams): Humanities Division: 8% did not meet the benchmark (i.e. took fewer than 3 classes in this division). 1% took zero classes. Social & Behavioral Sciences Division: 10% did not meet the benchmark. 2% took zero classes. Science & Math: 43% did not meet the benchmark. 14% took zero classes. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that many Amherst students use the open curriculum as a way to avoid science and math. Yes, some avoid humanities or social sciences, but not nearly as many. Another way to look at it: 92% of the Amherst Class of 2011 would have satisfied commonly used distribution requirements for humanities, and 91% would have done so in social sciences. But only 57% would have done so in science and math. https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/AC_NEASC_5_Year_Report_2013_0.pdf (Table: Class of 2011 Courses Attempted by Division, on p. 52).  ```\\n',\n",

I’m sure he’ll be successful regardless of the school he attends.  @intparent There’s more to life than work, money and the ranking and prestige of your alma mater and success isn’t measured by the size of your paycheck or who your work for.  Quality of life matters and a college needs to be a good fit in addition to offering a high quality education. There’s also a study by a Princeton economist found that the earnings of students from Ivies and students who were accepte at elite schools but chose to attend elsewhere were essentially the same. \"\"In 1999, economists from Princeton and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation looked at some of the same data Professor Eide and his colleagues had used, but crunched them in a different way: they compared students at more selective colleges to others of “seemingly comparable ability,” based on their SAT scores and class rank, who had attended less selective schools, either by choice or because a top college rejected them. The earnings of graduates in the two groups were about the same — perhaps shifting the ledger in favor of the less expensive, less prestigious route. (The one exception was that children from “disadvantaged family backgrounds” appeared to earn more over time if they attended more selective colleges. The authors, Stacy Berg Dale and Alan B. Krueger, do not speculate why, but conclude, “These students appear to benefit most from attending a more elite college.”)\"\" Congrats @pbmcdoug on making your decision.  Now you can enjoy the remainder of your senior year!  ```\\n',\n",

My S started dating someone the summer before his senior year in high school, and they kept up a long-distance relationship all four years of college, and are still together (moved to the same city) post graduation. So he wasn’t dating anyone at Bowdoin during his time there. My S is not outdoorsy at all, and was not an athlete, but he does love cold weather. He had never been in the state of Maine before he did a trip the summer before his senior year of high school, but fell in love with Bowdoin and applied ED. I think both schools are academic peers. My S did a minor in Government & Legal Studies (majored in History and a foreign language) and really enjoyed his time at Bowdoin. He is still on the east coast, finishing his second year of law school, and goes back to Bowdoin for homecoming and graduation.  ```\\n',\n",

Stevens does not arbitrarily withdraw scholarships. If a scholarship or financial aid offer is made contingent upon maintaining a certain minimum GPA, that will be clearly stated in the offer. I have never heard of the GPA requirements for a scholarship being changed arbitrarily after the fact of any Stevens student or graduate I know personally, nor did it happen to me when I was a student there. If you really believe Rowan and TCNJ are on the same level and attract the same calibre of students and that their outcomes are as good as Stevens (check out Payscale’s survey, which puts Stevens at 15th of 1134 US colleges and universities for starting salaries and ROI on tuition, whereas Rowan and TCNJ are somewhere in the 150s I believe), well, you are mistaken. Stevens has the highest selectivity, highest SAT scores, highest average high school GPA, and highest percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school classes of entering freshmen/women of all NJ schools with the exception of Princeton University. Students clamor to attend Stevens whereas from my vantage point I see students leaving New Jersey to go to college, despite Rowan, Rutgers, TCNJ, et al being “inexpensive” for NJ residents. If those schools are so good and such a good value, then why do so many NJ students leave the state? Stevens and Princeton are the only NJ universities that NJ students really want to attend. In the realm of NJ public engineering schools, everyone outside of NJ has heard of Rutgers. Nobody outside of this area has heard of Rowan or TCNJ, seriously. I have had job interviews in a dozen different states. All of my interviewers knew of Stevens (and Rutgers). Many scholarship offers at all schools have minimum GPA requirements. Donors and benefactors of scholarships frequently impose conditions that the student must meet in order to retain the scholarship, and GPA is a very common one. Those are stated in the offers. I had to maintain a specific GPA to keep my scholarship at Stevens for example, and that was clearly specified from the beginning.  ```\\n',\n",

It wasn’t enough to dissuade him, but I remember talking about it. For me, it ended up being fantastic in ways I wouldn’t have imagined. When the kids come home early Thanksgiving week, they are home until January. This meant a couple of things … One, there was no expensive, extra trip home two holidays in a row. You never know what the weather will be like in MN in November. We never had to worry whether those pricey tickets we bought were going to get eaten because he couldn’t get out or back due to weather or that the trip was severely shortened because of delays and such. When he got home for turkey, he was home past New Year’s. Ds2, who is at a faraway school on the semester system, has never come for Thanksgiving. Two, that long break was so welcome. His first two years, he worked for his summer employer. They were thrilled to have him filling 25 hours/week during the busy holiday season. And he loved the extra money.  The third year he got home the week before Christmas because he was abroad. The fourth year he used that extra time to study for the GRE and took it the week before he flew back. Three, people seemed to think that doing study abroad would be difficult because of the trimesters. Well, if you are doing a Carleton program that’s obviously not an issue. And kids, such as my ds, who do a non-Carleton program, just did it in the fall, when it’s an even trade (one trimester/one semester). And, they miss some of that cold weather by not going to campus until spring. Well, “spring.”     ```\\n',\n",

This year is the first time I have seen a 21 year old undergrad with a CS offer of $100k+ salary and another $100k+ in onboarding (signing bonus + relocation + stock/options). The talented CS kids seem to be really cleaning up this year. Are you seeing that more broadly?” I can’t really speak for companies outside of bay area, stocks are used as a differentiator out here and also to help these young kids get some money for housing :-).  So it’s tough to say whether Google uses stocks outside the bay area where they don’t run into other companies offering stock as a key part of their compensation.  ```\\n',\n",

That’s a CMU education or a UMD education and $3,000,000 when he turns 58. That’s the true difference when you consider the opportunity cost of the money ($270,000 at 6% annually for 40 years). Alternatively, it’s $1,500,000 at age 48. It would be a nice bridge between an early retirement and his fully funded 401k at 59.5. He might get a slightly better experience at CMU, maybe even a superior experience. What he won’t get though is an experience that’s even remotely close to $270,000 more valuable financially. You all have to decide if you are flush enough to provide that as a gift simply based on the experience. It’s unfortunately too late for this option now for you, but we had a plan for just this case. Not believing ANY undergraduate degree from ANY school is worth a quarter of a million dollars, we simply told our son that any program that netted out over $200k was off the table. The only schools he applied to, in addition to meeting all the requirements that he wanted out of a school, were schools that had reputations of granting good merit aid to high stats students. Tough choice, but the financial implications are real.  ```\\n',\n",

It is several campuses spread all over New Brunswick and Piscataway, and there are so many students who live nearby that the campus empties out every weekend. They go home. I live 45 minutes away, and even the kids who do live on campus freshman year usually move back home sophomore year because there just isn’t a lot going on. You can only tell so much by reading about it. Sometimes you have to experience it. I took classes post grad for a couple of years. Excellent instructors, well-respected program. But it could be lonely for an OOS student, and, well…go HOKIES!  ```\\n',\n",

Since Berkeley is roughly 5 times the size of Duke (and its student body is less academically diverse), Duke appears to be outperforming Berkeley handily on a per capita basis. This is just one metric but the point is that overall output should not be conflated with quality.  ```\\n',\n",

It was a fantastic place for our son.   However, I often do warn that it is too teeny./limited (85 grads per hear) for most students.    If you want a more traditional college experience, GT may be better.   For completeness I will add more info about Olin too. Olin grads do have decent prospects for internships and jobs.  The job fairs I think have more companies than annual graduates.   You may find this link helpful - http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/careers-graduate-studies/results/.    There will definitely be employers who have NOT heard of Olin, more so as you get further from Boston.   The various rankings can help mitigate that - http://www.olin.edu/about/rankings-awards/ Olin does have many projects, especially compared to my Engineering program in 1980s.    It also has intense academics, but not in the traditional course sequences.   Many Olin admits are highly qualified - some have turned down offers MIT, Stanford, Princeton etc.  So there is a presumption that they already have a lot of AP/IB knowledge under their belt. Our son did do research at Olin (including the summer after Freshman year), but it was interwined with software engineering.  One project resulted in an award (with colleges that had more liberal arts kinds of CS than most STEM schools).  He also did poster presentation at a conference.  But these things were not due to intentional research focus - he intended to go to work, not grad school. The first link above includes To grad schools s  (the qty may be out of  all grads to date - under 1000… and I think a minority apply to grad schools) Harvard University  25 Stanford 21 MIT  20 Carnegie Mellon University 18 University of California Berkeley 15 Cornell 12 Olin students can also take classes at Babson (adjacent campus), Wellsley (campus loop bus), or Brandeis. I think the approach to have an Olin Candidate’s Weekend  is wise.  (first cut of admits come to campus on one of 3 weekends) .    I was not able to attend, but DH (also an engineer) went. with DS… and after that, they both were smitten. In Summary:  Olin can be a fine school if it is a good “fit”.    But it is a niche-fit, so students should careful study the pros/cons for their particular situation.  ```\\n',\n",

You said Stanford is at the top of the heap. Don’t underestimate how fast training indoors for a west coast athlete can get old. Being part of a huge (not just big) budget athletic program has perks mere mortals never see…higher level of travel comfort, competitive and training opportunities - some in other countries, academic support (a tutor) on the plane with you, as much gear as you can imagine, the best trainers brought in from all over the world, custom footwear - crazy stuff, but things that help you excel as an athlete and student. You are going to spend a lot of hours with this team and coach (coaches can change, but you likely have general idea of longevity if coach is a fixture there, but certainly the team), do you have a feeling of a fit with the guys/team culture at one or the other? From everything you have said, Stanford has more to offer you except a different coast and new experience. But it could be a new experience that is life changing for the better, or frankly it could be a bust. It is up to you to make either choice the experience you want it to be. It is ok to turn down Stanford, there are plenty of athletes that choose other schools for various reasons that are important to them. It is your life. Just be sure you are doing so based on significant reasons that are important to you. If your gut is not clearly ringing a loud bell then write down what is really important or matters in your choice - academics, athletic prestige, academic prestige, importance of winning, importance of winning level (NCAA Champion potential), coaches, team mates, location, family support nearby, big budget program, weather, size of school, support of athletes - anything at all that matters. Then prioritize them for you. Put the winner in one column and see which school has the most “victories.” Sometimes it is good to separate out factors that are all jumbled in your head and causing confusion. It can help you see what is important to you. And as a last thought, I always suggest students ask themselves this question…10 years from now, where do you want to say you graduated from? I assume you have until the November 8th-15th NLI period, which means someone has to be readying the paperwork now/very soon, so perhaps you have made your decision? Best to you!  ```\\n',\n",

It’s not like the decision will impact your personal success. That’s up to you. And it could be easily Iowa State for the right person. Go where you feel best suited for siccess. But neither school will assure success or be an impediment in any way.  Hopkins has a much bigger international reputation.  Pomona big time rep with sophisticated employers and schools. The cocktail party Johns Hopkins is quite impressive as well as with the same employer and grad school crowd.  What motivates you.  What will push you to be your best.  I would choose Hopkins for the immediate recognition of value and the competitive  atmosphere. But as we have heard. Pomona is really tough too and Hopkins is collaborative in its own way.  ```\\n',\n",

Most people don’t go to a strong 4 year college with the goal of becoming a Starbucks barista upon graduation. That said, you won’t likely start your first job as president of a company. IMO, don’t major in”what will make you a lot of money”,  study what YOU want, what will make you thrive in college, do well and be interesting to employers. Even if you decided to  do Teach for America for a year or so after college, you may choose to go to grad school, a professional school, or move on to a job where your experience will help get a foot in the door. Enjoy college. Don’t think of it as a trade school.  ```\\n',\n",

All you have to do is to look at the CEOs of top engineering firms to know that your thesis is patently false. Boeing’s current CEO, Dennis Muilenberg went to undergrad at Iowa State. United Launch Alliance…Tony Bruno…Cal Poly. Tim Cook…Apple…Auburn. Larry Page…Alphabet…Michigan. Larry Ellison…Oracle…Illinois (and didn’t graduate). Satya Nadella…Microsoft…first US degree, MS from Wisconsin-Milwaukee. I could go on and on. Sure, you can find some, Jeff Bezos for example, that did go to a “top” institution, Princeton. Of the top 20 Fortune 500 CEOs though, he’s the only one that hails from the Ivy League. If your story were true all the top spots would be held by grads of “top” schools. They demonstrably are not. Back to my previous post about JPL’s executive board. Here’s where they were educated: Texas A&M, Sam Houston State, Cal Poly, Cal Poly Pomona, UCLA, Texas, MIT, Colorado, Washington, Toronto, USC and Purdue. Caltech manages JPL, yet there isn’t a single Caltech grad in the top echelon of the organization and only one that hails from a “top” institution. So, you might not be sure, but I am. Engineering is egalitarian and there’s LOTS of evidence proving it.  ```\\n',\n",

Yes, some avoid humanities or social sciences, but not nearly as many.” That may be true.  It doesn’t change the fact that the students at Amherst who DO choose to do science and math fare very well and have excellent opportunities and college support for further academic study like PhDs, for medical school and other professional schools, and for recruiting to businesses.   Forbes just ranked Amherst No. 1 in the nation on its list of Private Colleges Worth Every Penny. https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliesportelli/2017/04/26/10-expensive-colleges-worth-every-penny-2017/#5943768d5f6a Again, I want to emphasize that Carleton is also an excellent school and would be a great option.  ```\\n',\n",

He ended up getting merit at USC but chose another school in the end. Part of the reason was that he realized he did not want to commit to living in Southern California after graduation. Also, it was not the strongest fit after he spent a night there during interview weekend. Other schools did a better job with overnight visits. The University Village is impressive on the outside but less conducive to meeting lots of people as compared with a regular dorm, based on the suite arrangements. It’s not that you can’t meet people if you room at the Village. It’s just a little less easy as a dorm such as Birnkrant. Costs are also very high (from rent to insurance to gas to you name it) in Los Angeles.That would be true of Boston as well. I think you are smart to consider what your ultimate goal is in terms of living and working after four years. Not everyone knows the answer but in your case, you seem to be pretty certain about working on the East Coast. Marshall Business school is strongest in L.A. and Asia. Many on CC are rah rah about the Trojan alumni network but I don’t think it rings true nearly like in Southern Cal. I would go with your instincts and choose either UNC or BC. If you are like my S, you’ll lean towards the school that is offering you a sure admit into the major you would like to study and where you click with the student body. You can take a chance on UNC and getting into the B school. If you don’t get into the business school, you could probably major in econ or something else. Raleigh would have the second best weather of the choices  but BC offers you the direct admit to the business school in the part of the country that you would like to ultimately work.  ```\\n',\n",

Michigan is the obvious choice when it’s so economically superior and arguably better in the subject being studied as a major.

Yes, the popularity of CS programs at Mudd and Pomona has led to staffing and course-registration issues.  Majors get priority for required classes, but not for additional electives beyond the requirements, and people are understandably unhappy about this. Hopefully some solutions will be found, but it is an issue.  ```\\n',\n",

The students from all four colleges are mixed, which is excellent. My D ended up being good friends with some people who she has about zero in common with on paper, but their personalities clicked. It is priceless when that happens. The rooms are not the best, but it is a right of passage at Penn to say you lived in the Quad. Most students will say that they are glad they did it, but they would not want to do it again. The rooms are not anything special, but they made a lot of friends there. That is the main point of being freshmen together.   ```\\n',\n",

I don’t have anything to say about either Duke or Brown.  They both seem like very good schools.  All I can say is that studies show that your son’s choice of college probably won’t affect his career earnings.  However, that doesn’t say anything about his experience for the next 4 years. My only advice, which addresses the academic experience and not the social experience, would be for your son to read the course catalogs of the two universities and try to make up a 4-year schedule for each.  Are there courses or programs that seem more appealing at one versus the other?  Brown offers an Open Curriculum, which gives students a lot of choice, but is that something that your son would take advantage of?  On the other hand, Duke has more traditional General Education requirements, and maybe those classes seem more in line with your son’s preferences.  Perhaps your son’s anticipated major has more advanced electives at one university compared with the other, or a more well thought-out introductory series. Best of luck with his decision!  ```\\n',\n",

There is a lot of false hearsay on this thread alone.  Case in point @Penn95 Where on earth are you getting the deflation stats?  JHU’s average GPA across the campus is a 3.35.  Is that major grade deflation?  Is Cornell’s “nowhere near that bad”?  Where do you pull this stuff. As for prestige, I would argue JHU over both (I chose Hopkins over Cornell but did not apply to Dartmouth). But that is subjective as well.  ```\\n',\n",
