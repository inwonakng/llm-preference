  While browsing the College Confidential website, you come across posts where users discuss and compare two or three universities. Analyze a user's comment and determine their preference for two given universities.
  Here are the rules:
  1. The comment will be prefixed with "Comment: ".
  2. The two given universities will be prefixed with "Choices: ", and separated by "&". For example, "Choices: California Institute of Technology & Johns Hopkins University", California Institute of Technology is the first university and Johns Hopkins University is the second university.
  3. Answer "first" if you think the user prefers the first university over the second university, "second" if you think the user prefers the second university over the first university, "equal" if you think the user thinks the both universities are equal, and "no" if you think there is no preference in the comment.
  4. You must complete the rest coming after "Response: ".
  Only answer "first", "second", "equal" or "no". Do not give any other answer rather than these. Do not include any other text in your response. 

confirmation:
  - Answer "YES" if you are ready.
  - YES, I am ready. Please provide the user's comment and the two universities they are comparing.
