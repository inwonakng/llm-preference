instruction: |
  You will be given two colleges A and B, and a comment. Your job is to identify the preference between the two given colleges in the comment. 
  The names of the two colleges and the comment are delimited with triple backticks.

  I will ask you the following questions one by one.
  1. Is there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?
  2. If there is a preference, summary the comment.
  3. If there is a preference in the summary from step 2, what is the preference between the two colleges?

  Here are the shared rules for both questions:
  You MUST refer to the colleges as A or B. 
  You MUST NOT respond with any other response. 
  You MUST NOT make up a preference when there is no preference in the comment.

question_1st_stage: |
  Is there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?
  You MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.
  You MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.

task: |
  College A: ```{alternative_a}```
  College B: ```{alternative_b}```
  Comment: ```{text}```

question_summary: |
  Summarize the comment with preference.
  Here are the guidelines:\
  1. The comment will be prefixed with "Comment: ".\
  2. The two given universities will be prefixed with "Choices: ", and separated by "&". 
  Examples: "Choices: California Institute of Technology & Johns Hopkins University".
  3. Now you must give your answer after "Response: ".\
  The response must include the names of the given two universities from "Choices" and the preference of the "Comment".\
  Last but not the least, If the comment is about the reference between California Institute of Technology and Johns Hopkins University, \
  but the choise is university California Institute of Technology and  Boston university, you should just response "No preference stated between California Institute of Technology and Boston university".
  4. Do not overly deduce

  Based on your responce. What is the preference between the two colleges?
  You MUST respond ```A is preferred over B``` if college A is preferred over college B.
  You MUST respond ```B is preferred over A``` if college B is preferred over college A.
  You MUST respond ```Equal preference``` if colleges A and B are equally preferred.

retry_msg_1st_stage: |

  Here is a reminder of the rules:
  You MUST NOT use the colleges' real names.
  You MUST refer to the colleges as A or B. 
  You MUST NOT make up a preference when there is no preference in the comment.
  You MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.
  You MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.
  You MUST respond with ```No preference``` or ```Has preference```.

retry_msg_summary: |
  Your current response was incorrect, because your previous response did not include the names of the given two universities from Choices.\
  Please update your approach to ensure your response:
    - Includes the names of the given two universities from Choices
    - States which university is preferred, or if there is no preference
  If the comment is about the reference between California Institute of Technology and Johns Hopkins University, \
  but the choise is university California Institute of Technology and Boston university, response "No preference stated between California Institute of Technology and Boston university".
  Let's try again, remember that your response is within 3-20 words, and do not overly deduce!
