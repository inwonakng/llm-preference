That matters to some and doesn\u2019t bother others in the slightest, particularly when the schools of interest vary so greatly in size. YMMV.

Unsurprisingly, Georgia Tech has more than a few large classes \u2013 a whopping 26% of its classes have more than 50 students, compared to 10% at JHU and Caltech. Caltech and JHU report that 67% and 74% of their classes have fewer than 20 students, respectively; at Georgia Tech, 39% of classes have fewer than 20 students. Of course, it is always best to check the enrollments in the departments of interest. It does a BME student no good if all of the small classes at his/her university are in departments like German and music.  ```\n",
