He is also in charge of the fundraising for the Baja Race Team this year, and will be going with the team to the annual SAE Baja Race event in Kansas this summer.  Last year he also did the Robotic Sail team but dropped it this year as the time commitment for it was too much.  He took a class at Wellesley last semeste.  He seems to be going to Boston or the neighboring area with classmates about every other week or so.  It all depends on the student and what passion he or she has and wants to pursue.  There is nothing at Olin to limit students if they want to truly do something outside of class.  ```\n",
