In other words, is it a short-term or a long-term goal? Will you be an average or top contributor at P, at S? Have you done any research on which college supports athletes better adapt to rigorous academic environment? What are their graduation success rate like? (These are available from their respective athletic depts.) Regarding academic life: Do you prefer a larger school setting or a smaller LAC-like school? For comparison, Stanford has about 2,000 more undergrad students than Princeton, which has about 5,200. Stanford\u2019s grad student population is about 11,000 whereas Princeton\u2019s grad student population is about half of its undergrad population at 2,700. Stanford has Med, Law and Business schools. By institutional design, Princeton doesn\u2019t. There are pros and cons to either environment, and it\u2019s up to each individual student preference. What do you intend to major in? Which school has greater strength in your area of academic interest? What resources does each school have for assisting you towards your career path given your major? What pedagogical style do you prefer? Princeton has the Preceptorial Method which is a modified Oxford tutorial learning environment with 5:1 student-teacher ratio. I\u2019m not as familiar with Stanford\u2019s pedagogical methods, so I\u2019ll leave that for other knowledgeable folks to contribute here. Princeton has residential college (6) system, and each college where you\u2019d be housed is staffed by 1) the college dean, 2) director of studies, 3) faculty advisers, 4) peer academic advisers and 5) director of student life, a staff member dedicated to support your health and well being. Again, I\u2019m not familiar with Stanford counterpart to this so I\u2019ll leave this up to others to contribute here. You can\u2019t go wrong with either of these great institutions. However, they\u2019re very different in culture and experience, so do make a wise decision based on YOUR personality and needs. One big mistake I\u2019ve seen so many young students make is going with what their peers think are a greater choice when instead they need to really dig into their self-knowledge of who they\u2019re and what they want to accomplish in life. In other words, DON\u2019T go with either the Ivy hype or the Stanford hype. Go with what\u2019d fulfill your life in the long run.  ```\n",
