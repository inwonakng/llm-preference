The pre-med mindset will affect your experience at either school, but probably more so at JHU where it is the reason so many seek out the school.  CogSci not quite as pre-med dominated as neuroscience, because many CogSci majors are more oriented toward Linguistics and/or CompSci.  Pomona has a joint department of CogSci and Linguistics, and offers a computation-oriented track of the CogSci major. Being in the consortium with Harvey Mudd further deepens the CS and AI offerings. But JHU is strong in CompSci too. Both schools have strong departments in all of your areas of interest. And I don\u2019t think you have to worry about the strength of Pomona\u2019s reputation within any academic or academic-adjacent community. Neither should inherently advantage or disadvantage you for grad school admissions relative to the other. As you know, the vibes and environments are much different. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Pomona is more nurturing and undergrad-focused, whereas Hopkins will have more going on at the graduate level if you want the exposure to that. It\u2019s a least a clear choice between two distinctly different experiences!  Both top-notch - congrats on having this tough decision to make!  ```\n",
