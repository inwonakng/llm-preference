The only way to get an engineering degree at Amherst would be through a 5-year program, where you spend years 3 and 5 at Dartmouth. Such programs are commonly offered by liberal arts colleges, but rarely utilized in practice;. Amherst says that only one or two students per class go that route. http://www3.amherst.edu/~waloinaz/engineering.html HMC is great for engineering, but maybe not so good for pre-med. HMC does offer common pre-med majors, like biology and chemistry, although they are less popular than engineering. However, it may be difficult to maintain a high GPA at Mudd, as noted above, especially if you also want to swim competitively:  [quote] Prospective pre-medical students considering Harvey Mudd should realize that the College\u2019s technical requirements are considerably more demanding than in typical pre-med programs [/quote]  https://www.hmc.edu/biology/programs-and-courses/pre-med-preparation/ So while both paths are theoretically possible at both institutions, you should assume that Amherst sends far more students to med school than into engineering, while HMC sends far more students into engineering than to med school. So in practice, these two schools may not be the best choices if you are truly undecided and want to keep both options open. There are few LACs that are good for both pre-med and engineering. Swarthmore would be an obvious pick, or Smith if you are female. If you can swim competitivelly at a low Division I level, then Bucknell or Lafayette. If you want to stick to Division III, then maybe consider small DIII universities, like Tufts or Rochester, as well as LACs.  ```\n",
