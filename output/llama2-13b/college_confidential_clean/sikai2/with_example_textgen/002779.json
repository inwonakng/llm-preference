Both of mine, and many friends, were Bonner Leaders.  It\u2019s all there. My impression was how friendly kids are. Confident. Open. Directed,  but not primarily pre-professional.  Clearly, some places where Linda\u2019s and my observations don\u2019t overlap shows this variety. \u201cUrban\u201d is an interesting word- in the sense that many have a comfort in various situations, have experiences to bring. But I think you\u2019d find that at Ham, too. It\u2019s a quality of the more selective NE LACs. The heavy campus party scene may have diminished somewhat, as the new president announced she\u2019d clamp down. My phrase, when mine were there was, \u201cWork hard, party hard.\u201d (Though D2 spent plenty of weekend evenings in the library. And D1 joked, Sun am, everyone is back to work.) At the same time, there\u2019s a hard reason Ham made the frats non-res, parties in public areas. Athletes were no divide, for mine. Take a look at club and activity offerings. Also, we haven\u2019t even gotten to things like study abroad opps or how short term can be used.  ```\n",
