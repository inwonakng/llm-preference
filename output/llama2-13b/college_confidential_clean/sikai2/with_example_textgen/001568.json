To begin with, over the course of a succesful career in medicine, 60,000 is effectively meaningless.  Just do the math of lifetime earnings of a physician.  To turn down a superior opportunity over 60,000 is poor thinking.  So, is Yale superior?  The posters keep saying it doesn\u2019t matter where you go undergraduate for med school admissions, but that is absolutely false.  Yale, as a matter of fact, gets a higher percentage of students, at a lower GPA, then Madison into medical school.  Medical school admission rates are as low as Stanford and Harvard for undergraduate.  Wouldn\u2019t you want every advantage.  And to suggest that because people at Yale are smarter than people at Madison that your grades will be lower proportionately, is also not factual.  Top schools are known for grade inflation and helping students.  And Madison has many talented students in pre-med.  The idea that you can breeze through pre-med weed out courses at Madision and would struggle at Yale is simply guess work.  But the flawed nature of the advice, even from a financial perspective, comes out when you take a closer look at med school admissions and merit aid.  Top med schools also have better financial aid and better MERIT aid.  If you do well at Yale, you will be much more likely to be accepted at a top medical school with better aid and medical school is much much more expensive than undergraduate.  And if you want MERIT aid for medical school, you better be a top top applicant.  Now, if the amount is 240,000, that is different story because then you may end up borrowing on top of that amount for medical school, and that total number will balloon. I am not knocking Madison at all.  Great school.  But the poor advice here needs to be addressed.  ```\n",
