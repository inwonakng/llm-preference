I know quite a bit about Rice; I am an alum and my daughter was accepted into the Rice Class of 2022 and will be attending. Here is some info on Rice, if you want to assess whether it is a fit:  research university with a distinctive commitment to undergraduate education; about 50% STEM, 50% humanities/social sciences just under 4000 undergraduates happily nerdy student body very community focused, and many systems in place that support students and tight knit community - residential college system in particular diversity is part of the Rice experience and mission; Rice seeks students who come from many different backgrounds and students who are comfortable with people from all different backgrounds collaborative, supportive environment A philosophy that \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d; Rice is known for its \u201cculture of care\u201d. This is so important to Rice because Rice wants its students to continue care strongly about other people as they go into the world Rice students and graduates are committed to making the world a better place  As mentioned in this thread, the location across from the Texas Medical Center is ideal for pre-meds. Undergraduate research is big at Rice. I just read an article about the three 2018 Goldwater Scholars at Rice this year. Lots of incredible things going on at Rice! Another thing going on at Rice that many don\u2019t know about is the focus on leadership skills for undergraduates. The Doerr Institute for New Leaders is available to any undergraduate who wants to develop their leadership skills. Take a look at the video: https://doerr.rice.edu Good luck to you as you make your decision!  ```\n",
