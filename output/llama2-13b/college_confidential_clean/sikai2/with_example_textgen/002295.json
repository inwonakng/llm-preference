U of M receives limited state money and has to take most of its undergrads from the state of Michigan. Making matters worse, the State of Michigan\u2019s public education is in a death spiral which is making qualified in-state candidates scarce (see link below). Historically, U of M\u2019s advantages are their strong alumni base, its large endowment, and sports. However, sports seems to be sliding with the football team losing 12 out of the last 13 games to Ohio State and 8 out of the last 10 games to Michigan State. Given their situation, I don\u2019t see how they can improve their undergrad situation significantly unless the State allows them to go private, which I think is unlikely. http://www.freep.com/story/news/education/2016/05/18/michigan-students-sliding-toward-bottom/84535876/  ```\n",
