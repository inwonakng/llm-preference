Kelley attracts students from all over the country. UGA does not offer that kind of diversity. By no means, Kelley is Wharton or Michigan Ross, but it does attract a lot of students who had to consider those schools and probably did not get in. Kelley is known throughout the country whereas Terry is much more regional. I think the OP should visit OSU Fisher as well if visiting Bloomington. They are about 3 hours away from each other.  ```\n"
