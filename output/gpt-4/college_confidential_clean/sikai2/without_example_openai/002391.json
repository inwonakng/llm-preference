Bowdoin\u2019s Outing Club is famous.  They have their own permanent building on campus, and they own both an island and a remote cabin.  They organize multiple trips a week.  And to end up being a leader they send you on a 300 hour certification program that pretty much makes you an expert survivalist.  But for casual members they do everything from simple hikes, biking or kayaking to extreme hiking and camping.  Not taking anything away from Midd which is a great school too but would be hard to say any school is a level up from Bowdoin on outdoorsy student opportunity.  ```\n"
