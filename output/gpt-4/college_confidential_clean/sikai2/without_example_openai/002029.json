I will say right now I compete directly with mcCombs kids and a few plan 2 kids from UT Austin.  If she is not in the business school at UT I don\u2019t think it is worth it.  Between Kelley and Cox that is more of a best fit question.  The entirety of SMU undergrad is the size of Kelley, so that is more just a question of what she is interested in class sie, whether, etc.  Many of the kids I go to school with were in at ut mccombs, and chose SMU.  They were not plan 2 or mccombs honors though - those are on another level. Great opportunities for sure wherever she may go.  ```\n"
