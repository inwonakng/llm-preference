The modern phenomenon of low admit rates is largely due to the relative ease of applying to multiple schools combined with marketing programs to get as many to apply or not whether or not they are qualified.  A cynical view would be to say they are inducing unqualified students to apply to be rejected.  The number of high stat kids has not skyrocketed (although high school grade inflation is rampant).  Unfortunately, other metrics used by USNews are open to manipulation as well. I would say historically, BC has had the better reputation and a more traditional campus experience.  BU has made some significant gains and is experiencing some of the trendiness that some urban campuses are experiencing.  It is difficult to say if that is going to continue or whether trends will change. I think they are probably close enough in reputation that I would suggest going on fit.  ```\n"
