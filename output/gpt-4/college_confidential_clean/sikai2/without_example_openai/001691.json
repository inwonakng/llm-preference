Everyone is \u201csplitting hairs\u201d about students at Duke vs Michigan!!  Seriously!! Please quantify for me in the scheme of life, why Duke will be better or even Michigan will be better!  I think this is my last post, because if anyone thinks they are \u201cbetter\u201d aka superior attending one over the other they are wrong. As my dad would say we all bleed the same blood and we all meet our maker in the end so make your time mean something.  ```\n"
