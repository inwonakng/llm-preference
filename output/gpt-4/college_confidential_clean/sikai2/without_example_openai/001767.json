I think that 4 years is a long time and that school that is the best social fit is probably the best fit. I also think that Michigan will be less demanding than MIT, but that may be good, because it can afford the OP with more time to get involved in research, being a TA, participating in coding clubs, adding a minor in math or stats, prepping for interviews, and other valuable bells and whistles. However, each student is different. For example, if the OP is planning a CS major, top CS students are being offered compensation of over $200k/year directly out of college. In that case, $250k in education costs is a lot, but it is not insurmountable if the student believes that they will thrive better in the MIT environment.  ```\n"
