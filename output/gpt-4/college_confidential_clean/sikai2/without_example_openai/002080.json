That\u2019s the amount a college graduate can reasonably expect to pay back over ten years. Not 25-30 per year. So, to go back: what can your parents pay if they don\u2019t take loans for you? If they pay from their income and savings and use the college\u2019s payment plan to spread payments over ten months, what can they pay per year?  ```\n"
