Its not the cost of the undergraduate, but the total cost of undergraduate plus medical school.  Its also the ability to fulfill the dreams of a medical career.  It is not accurate to say that GT will necessarily produce the same result, although it could.  You are assuming that going to GT will lead to the same medical school and same cost as Harvard.  I am not assuming anything.  The facts show that Harvard students obtain admission to elite medical schools at a much higher rate.  Go onto the websites of the top medical schools and see how many came from Harvard and how many from GT.  Now, I don\u2019t think it is a mistake to go to GT.  It is a great school and free.  If you do extraordinarily well, you will get into medical school and maybe get merit money.  Life doesn\u2019t give you pat answers.  But, I guess I just don\u2019t get the simplistic analysis that Harvard or other elite schools are just \u201cprestige\u201d or \u201cnames.\u201d  They offer a lot beyond the name and here it is a fact that those resources lead to admission to top medical schools at much higher rate than GT and likely a much higher cost.  If you give that up fine, but don\u2019t argue that all you are giving up is a name.  ```\n"
