A colleague of mine was a UC Berkeley grad about 25+ years ago and was in the PhD program at Duke.  He never felt comfortable with the surrounding areas.  He said at that time, there were quite a few hillbillies around the Duke campus area and felt uneasy. Eventually, he dropped out of the PhD program.  But that was 25+ years ago and maybe things have changed since then.  ```\n"
