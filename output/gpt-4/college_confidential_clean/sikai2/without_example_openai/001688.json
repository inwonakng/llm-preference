I could have taken the SAT 4 more times and I likely would have gotten it over the 1500 mark vs. my 1470, it was a matter of answering 2 more questions right!!  So I am one student who will bring down Michigan\u2019s average over a Duke.  But, I have a 3.9 weighted GPA in the most rigorous courses at an \u201celite\u201d private school in the northeast. I have friends who got into Duke, Northwestern,Vanderbilt with higher test scores, but easier classes but some of those same friends were rejected from Michigan.  I think just maybe Michigan looks a bit deeper into what kind of student they accept.  Their Common Data Set puts Rigor and School performance above test scores. Go to Michigan, it truly has more to offer overall and for those who are so driven by rankings it IS ranked better for Engineering.  ```\n"
