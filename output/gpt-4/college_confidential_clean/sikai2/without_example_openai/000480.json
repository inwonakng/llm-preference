A masters in accounting has become the norm for someone staring out from schools like IU or UGA.  It\u2019s not required, but it\u2019s definitely something that you should get while you\u2019re there. Why not a MBA?  The OP will take a variety of business classes and have a solid base in management when they leave school.  Plus there will be ample on the job training in their first 5 years.  Adding an MBA after those 5 years might be helpful, but most likely it won\u2019t.  Getting an MBA after a MACC will most likely cause employers to think you are chasing credentials, and that is a dangerous tag these days. So what extra education would I recommend to a an accounting grad?  Something in tech like a coding or software engineering bootcamp.  More and more the people around me tackle business problems like a software developer instead of like an MBA, and understanding that methodology and terminology would be beneficial.  ```\n"
