Mt Vernon is about 10-15 minutes away, more of a town, with the usual chains and franchises, but still not a lot in terms of employment. Columbus is about an hour away, much of it on back roads, so not a mindless commute. Cleveland is close to 2 hours. Gambier really is the middle of nowhere . . . .you either love it, or not!  ```\n"
