You should expand your horizons in terms of jobs you would be looking for. \u2013You should look at the core requirements for both schools (can be found online).  Chances are at BC you would have to spend a great deal of time taking classes like theology, philosophy etc.  to complete the Jesuit core. \u2013I\u2019d consider the schools to be academic peers.   I\u2019d go to UNC and avoid debt \u2013 being debt free will give you more options down the road.  ```\n"
