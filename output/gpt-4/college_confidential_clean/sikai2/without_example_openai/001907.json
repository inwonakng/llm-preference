Might be more challenging than you think\u2026and you\u2019re going to be surrounded by kids like you, who are chasing the merit money.  Smart kids, engaged kids! I lived in NYC for a long time, and then moved to Alabama.  It was a rough transition, but I wasn\u2019t on a college campus.  There are TONS of out-of-state students at Alabama these days. The $60K is the winning argument, however.  That is a lot of money to be saving\u2026and sets you up nicely for grad school. My vote is for ROLL TIDE!  ```\n"
