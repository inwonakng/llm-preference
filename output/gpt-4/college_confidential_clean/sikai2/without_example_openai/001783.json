However, in this case, I don\u2019t think you will find it. You have to know someone who is directly involved in the process. That is why people do not like to discuss it. Try reaching out privately to people who are on the inside of what\u2019s happening with tech offers at MIT, Harvard, Carnegie, Berkeley, Stanford, Penn, Columbia, Cornell etc. Be sure to total compensation including signing bonuses, and equity stakes. Privately, they will tell you. [/quote]  For the OP, a $280,000 bet on unverified claims of compensation that may still not be what most graduates from MIT will find?  ```\n"
