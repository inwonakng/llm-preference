Princeton no longer officially has grade deflation but not all longtime Profs change so easily.  And you don\u2019t have a mid-term every week in a quarter system but as noted you don\u2019t have as much time to catch up if you fall behind so you have to be more diligent.  I\u2019m not placing a value judgement on grade inflation or rigor - different students want different things but it helps to have as much information as possible to make a decision.  All I\u2019m saying is that Stanford has more rigor options than Princeton with the huge Athletic program being one of the main reasons.  ```\n"
