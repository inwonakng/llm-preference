Nobody comes around in the morning to ask if you remembered your vitamins or to take your dirty clothes to the laundry. The big difference is that classes at a LAC are consistently small (usually &lt; 20 students, seldom 50 or more); there are no (or few) pre-professional majors (architecture, business, engineering, etc.); total focus is on undergrads; there are fewer majors and course offerings. In some respects, LACs may be more challenging for undergrads than research universities, although I\u2019m generalizing here (not directly comparing McG & MoHo). At a LAC, you generally can\u2019t sleep your way through a lecture class without the professor noticing. You can expect more class discussion. You\u2019ll probably have more faculty-graded writing assignments, more essay (or short answer) questions on exams, and fewer easily-graded multiple choice (or true/false) tests. You\u2019ll be expected not only to keep up with the reading for class, but also to think about and discuss it, starting in year one. If you cut classes, your absence is more likely to be noticed soon. Grading standards could be tougher or easier (it depends on the school). Montreal should have a strong edge in internship opportunities over South Hadley and Amherst (although I\u2019m not familiar with how jobs/internships work for internationals in Canada.)  If money is no object, Montreal is a great restaurant city with shops, museums, etc., that you won\u2019t find in the South Hadley area.  ```\n"
