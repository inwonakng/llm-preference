For D1 sports it has lacrosse, but if you enjoy college sports there are several other schools in the area that are D1 (Towson, Loyola, Navy) and you could follow those teams. There are also the professional teams in both Baltimore and DC.  Pomona is not far from Anaheim and you\u2019d have the Angels and the Ducks, but everything else is in LA. I didn\u2019t understand if you are from Toronto or just plan to live there in the future.  Hopkins is a lot closer if it is your home.  ```\n"
