They\u2019re both sort of in the boonies. They are both academically sound. If you are that worried about greek life separating students, I\u2019d go with Bates. But really, I think the Hamilton campus is more beautiful. With its Science Center it\u2019s a cross between Middlebury and Amherst with its quad appointed with adirondak chairs. Hamilton has the focus on writing, and its quite the manicured campus. You can see immediately where your money is going. I think it also has a better town. Lewiston\u2013kind of run down. My choice would be Hamilton.  ```\n"
