The converse is almost certainly true. https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2015/02/04/the-top-feeder-schools-to-wall-street/2/ Wall Street Oasis\u2019 list of undergraduate feeder schools has Duke at 29th globally (between Yale and Stanford). Brown doesn\u2019t make the top 50. https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2014/10/10/linkedins-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-rankings/4/ Linkedin has Duke 7th for finance. Brown is 17th. etc. etc. ^ Registration is required PS: If you think I\u2019m cherry picking, it would be great if you could produce a single ranking that has Brown over Duke for finance (in terms of employment prospects).  ```\n"
