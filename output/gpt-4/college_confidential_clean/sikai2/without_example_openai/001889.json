CMU does not have nearly the resources of Penn. For example, the Penn endowment is almost 10 times larger than CMU\u2019s. From my perspective, it is pretty clear that Penn offers you the best opportunity. The important thing for you is getting a lot of guidance on how to capitalize on all of those opportunities. The opportunities they offer will not benefit you if you don\u2019t know they exist or how to access and prioritize them. That is why I recommend that you begin by discussing that with an admissions counselor. Penn has incredible opportunities, but it is also fairly large and complex. Someone with experience can be a big help in guiding you in capturing the best opportunities that are aligned with your interests.  ```\n"
