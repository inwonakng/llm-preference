Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```@helpless2017 For the past few years, there have been more companies hiring at Olin each Spring Career Fair than there were graduates.  Not to mention that many graduates head to graduate schools so they are not even in the hiring pool.  I am not sure there is even a student academic ranking or how they go about selecting a valedictorian.  I would think companies hire based on the specific skills and internship experiences an individual student had, and if their area of interest matches the companies, or maybe the connections the students have made with the companies over the course of his/her work, studies, and projects.  ```\n"
