If you don\u2019t find an employer who will hire you for the OPT, you will need to go home almost immediately after you graduate. And do remember, when you have your interview for your student visa, you need to state clearly and believably that you intend to return to your country after completing your education and your OPT.  If the interviewer thinks that you intend to stay in the US longer than that, you will not get a visa.  ```\n"
