And yes, getting a 3.75 cGPA for Science subjects, even for the smartest of students, is not a cakewalk. [/quote]  Pitts requirements for the program include a minimum ACT/SAT of 34/1490 and they must maintain a 3.75 overall and science GPA. No MCAT is required. Given that there is a still a 50 percent drop-out rate with no MCAT, I would save the money and go to Yale. http://www.medadmissions.pitt.edu/admissions-requirements/guaranteed-admissions.php  ```\n"
