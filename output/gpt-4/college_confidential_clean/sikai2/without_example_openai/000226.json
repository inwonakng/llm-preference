H actually turned down NC State for VT when he got accepted off the wait list, but that was a few moons ago.  H owns his own company now, so I think he turned out ok. VT is similar that one gets into their specialty after the core courses unless they\u2019ve changed recently. The setting in Blacksburg is incredible. We loved our time there. It\u2019s only improved since our day. All that said, you could pick based upon finances or where you think you want to live once done and do just fine with degrees from any of your choices. We live in Penn State territory and know a fair number of successful grads from there too. Head down to NC where H is from and there are plenty of NC State grads doing well too. Best wishes to you with your selection.  ```\n"
