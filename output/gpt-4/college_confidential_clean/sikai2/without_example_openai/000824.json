Especially with life sciences and tech. But it\u2019s an offshoot to other stem studies.   Thayer street at brown is a fun strip of shops and restaurants. Brown interfuses with RISD students and old world New England architecture. It\u2019s a really a science meets hippy vibe. But there\u2019s also Ivy League prep and sporty types as well. It\u2019s quite a mix. There\u2019s a nice quad and central campus but a lot of the school is woven into the surrounding area and sports gym pools a short walk from the rest. It\u2019s a really cool place to go to school and is pretty intellectually focused for sure. Duke on the other hand is the traditional campus experience. Big time sports. School traditions. Tenting for tickets to the unc hoop game etc And a more  homogenous preppy but also smart and serous student body.  From s business standpoint It has evolved into perhaps the most prestigious and well connected school in the country. Outside of hpys  ```\n"
