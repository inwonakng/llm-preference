Have fun. It\u2019s okay to do so at this point in your young adult life. I know many students who are very academic & career focused. For them, the Honors College & the business school environment is motivating, exciting & working toward their career goals. You have mentioned briefly that business may not be your ultimate major. If undecided, then why invest the money at this stage of your life when you can use it for grad school or anything else ? After a few brief communications with you, I encourage you to stay close to home & be with your high school friends & enjoy all that Athens & a rollicking SEC school has to offer. If I thought that you were a bit more formal (for lack of a better word). I would suggest the University of Alabama Honors College or Auburn.  ```\n"
