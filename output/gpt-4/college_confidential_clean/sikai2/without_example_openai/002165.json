Princeton is in a beautiful little Hamlet of a town about an hour+ train ride away from the big cities of NYC and Philly. Stanford is a humongous urban campus about 30-45 minutes from San Jose and San Francisco. And for what its worth the building activity on the Peninsula near and around Palo Alto is crazy. Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s campuses are unbelievably large and growing larger by the minute in the towns surrounding Palo Alto (Mountain View and Menlo Park). Yesterday, while watching the Eagles-49ers (in Philly) game, and then little bit of the Washington-Dallas (near DC) football games, it was raining hard. I went for a run in my shorts and tank and enjoyed a cup of coffee in my backyard.   What a wonderful decision you have in front of you. Both outstanding schools and campuses. Best of luck.  ```\n"
