The swimming pool is over at Bryn Mawr.  I would look much more carefully at Bryn Maur classes rather than Penn, as its more accessible.   The train is not very far to Penn, but more effort.   For a business major, math matters a lot.  The more math you take the more MBA programs or law programs will accept you, but does depend a little on your law or business goals.  ```\n"
