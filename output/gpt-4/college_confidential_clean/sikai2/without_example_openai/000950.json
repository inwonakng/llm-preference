The closest one is MS & E. Some of the strongest kids switch to CS once they are in. And many will get internships at the top tech companies after 1st year. If you initially planned or worked all the way to what you have now, maybe you should stay with your original plan. Parents need to be able/willing/ready to pay to make it happen.  ```\n"
