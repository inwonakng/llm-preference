I believe P still does this. Another possible upside to P is being in the Ivy League and a more compact region, travel won\u2019t be as much of a grueling schedule compared to the spread out Pac-12. S&P are the best of the best and pretty much a tie for academics and prestige/reputation.  But I still say bottom line, the OP has to determine which athletic program/coaching/teammates/facilities he likes better as this will consume  most of his time.  ```\n"
