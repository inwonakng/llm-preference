You have no idea the students I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not talking about other Fellows. I\u2019m not sure where you keep getting your misinformation. I\u2019m also not sure why you are always posting non-responsive information about MBA programs when a student is asking about undergrad. It\u2019s not relevant.  At all. You are very misinformed. Funny you talk about Fellows now when the first time I saw you on a thread you swore Fellows had no chance at top companies.  Please stop. Your information about IU is also incorrect. As my student was heavily recruited by Kelley 2 years ago and took classes at IU, I know what I\u2019m talking about.  Where are you getting your misinformation? I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re a student with too much time on your hands.  ```\n"
