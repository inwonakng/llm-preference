[/quote]  If you were looking at NCAA championships, that\u2019s probably because men\u2019s crew is not an NCAA sport/championship where women\u2019s is.  If other sports are important to the OP, then Stanford will win in almost every list.  PAC 12 sports are fun to watch, fun to follow.  Marching band, cheerleaders, tailgating - all going to be better at Stanford.  Look at the events each crew attends.  Many might be the same events, but Stanford will go to regattas at Washington, UCLA, Oregon and Princeton will be heading to Boston and NYC more often.  ```\n"
