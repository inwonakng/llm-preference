You talk about the regret he\u2019d feel if he went to Yale and didn\u2019t get in to med school. What about the regret he\u2019d feel if he goes to Pitt and doesn\u2019t manage to stay in the GAP program? In the first case, he\u2019d at least have a Yale degree for almost free. And I don\u2019t think trying to maintain 3.75 GPA is less pressure than going through the regular med school process.  ```\n"
