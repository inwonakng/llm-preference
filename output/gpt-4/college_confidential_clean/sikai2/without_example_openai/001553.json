Just because that did not happen for your brother does not mean it does not happen for  other people.  Maybe he was more focused on his studies, or was not as social as you. Who knows. You will never know what would have happened for you had you attended a school like UW. My guess is most kids have a lot of fun there! As they do at Yale. Good luck to the OP with the decision!  ```\n"
