I\u2019m a Bates alum and my son is headed there as a freshman in the fall.  Lewiston is such an interesting city, full of surprises!  When I was there, many people spoke French - a vestige of the days when French-Canadian immigrants came to work in the mills. Here\u2019s an article about how the French language is bringing the different communities together (Franco-American and Francophone African).  Note the comments by Mary Rice-DeFosse, French Professor at Bates. http://www.npr.org/2017/03/27/521648929/in-maine-a-common-language-connects-french-canadians-african-immigrants I can\u2019t comment on Hamilton since I\u2019ve never been there.  I just know it\u2019s got a great reputation.  OP should go with his/her gut and not overanalyze!  Good luck!  ```\n"
