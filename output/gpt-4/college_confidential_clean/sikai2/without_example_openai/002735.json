Finance degree from Ross would help you for other careers on wall street but NOT to be a true quant. Quant teams hire math degrees, (and CS is pretty much like a math major), physics, engineers, operations research. Finance is a plus but not a substitute unless it\u2019s a quant focused degree as some b-schools have (not sure about Ross). Also note, I have worked for 3 decades on the street.  My current employer\u2019s President and many execs are Cornell grads.   A past employer was founded by a Cornell grad (who was also a board member at Cornell). There was a comment at the top of the thread about \u201cif it was any other ivy\u201d\u2026 Ridiculous comment. Cornell is VERY HEAVILY REPRESENTED on wall street in many many roles with many different types of degrees. That is totally incorrect the ivy comment.   In fact I have yet to meet a Brown graduate in my 3 decades on Wall Street.   Lots of Harvard and Penn, but honestly in a quant role people are most impressed by MIT and NONE of the ivies     Also note while there are MIch grads on wall street, there are far more Cornell grads in NYC and better networking opportunities as a result. A typical b-school degree will lead to very different career options than a math/cs focus regardless of the schools selected, so that should be the major deciding factor.   Ithaca is a wonderful college town, I doubt Ann Arbor has anything better to offer in day to day lifestyle than Ithaca, it is often voted one of the BEST college towns. Full disclosure, I do have a son at Cornell and less familiar with Michigan, but I know the difference between b-school and math/comp sci ( I studied comp sci/math/engineering myself and took some b-school classes as electives).  I worked in the quant and IT area of some of the largest best known banks and fund managers. I am a hiring manager and I would take the math/cs/ops research etc grad over any b-school grad in a quant role. If you wanted a different career path you can always later go get an MBA at a top b-school.  ```\n"
