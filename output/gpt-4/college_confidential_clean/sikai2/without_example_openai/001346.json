Your interest and affinity for STEM subjects puts you miles ahead of the average liberal arts and science graduate. Be careful taking various \u201creturn on investment\u201d (ROI) calculi too literally. Hamilton may have the highest. BUT, Wesleyan also has among the highest percentage of seniors going into the visual and performing arts within NESCAC (10.6%) - notoriously risky careers - right after graduation while Hamilton has among the lowest (4.5%) So, obviously, that\u2019s going to make a difference. Can you code? You can refine your computing skills at just about any of the top LACs; they are amply represented at places like Google.  ```\n"
