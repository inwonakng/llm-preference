If you were 100% set on Engineering, I would say that GA Tech is worth the extra money. Since you are not, it is not. Another way to make money is in Business/Finance, and I\u2019m sure both Hamilton and Wesleyan, as prestigious as they are in the northeast, have inroads to jobs in those fields. And the savings will help you in whatever you do.  ```\n"
