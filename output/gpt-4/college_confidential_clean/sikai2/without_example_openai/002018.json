If so, then SMU would be best. Would your daughter prefer 4 seasons or is she okay with hot weather? If she wants to see snow in the winter and and falls and springs that aren\u2019t too hot than she would like IU. What kind of environment is important to her? IU is in a great college town that\u2019s not too small or too big. SMU and UT Austin are in major cities. If she seeks more diversity in terms of race and socioeconomics then she might find more of that at UT and IU.  ```\n"
