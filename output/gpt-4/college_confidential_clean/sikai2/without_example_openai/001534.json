The question is whether a student who can get in to Yale would pull the same or better/worse GPA at UW-Madison, and it not at all clear that they would get a lower GPA at UW-Madison. If you argue that they\u2019d pull a lower GPA, you\u2019d be making the argument that UW-Madison is more rigorous than Yale.  ```\n"
