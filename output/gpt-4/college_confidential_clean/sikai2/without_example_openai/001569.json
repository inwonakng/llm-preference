As a doctor, especially if you end up specializing, that 60K plus the cost of med school really wouldn\u2019t be a terrible burden.  You most likely will be able to pay if off a few years into your practice.  But if you intend to go into academic medicine or just do family practice, then financially it might become a bit tight.  Yale is a brand name giving you opportunities to open up a lot of doors.  ```\n"
