Duke as a university tends to care very little about standardized test scores (look at Duke med, Fuqua, etc.) so claiming that Duke is \u201cnotorious\u201d for doing that tells me that you are misinformed. Also, it would be prudent to refrain from making assertions that you cannot back up. 2). Standardized test scores are probably more informative than GPAs because they are STANDARDIZED. 3). Do you really think that Duke\u2019s GPA range is lower than Berkeley\u2019s? Seems highly improbable but I can\u2019t find data on Duke\u2019s GPA range.  ```\n"
