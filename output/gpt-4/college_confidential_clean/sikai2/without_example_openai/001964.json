You\u2019re absolutely right about the importance of a general education. I\u2019m speaking as a strong supporter of a liberal arts education, though, and not everyone shares my view. Cal is notably stronger in the field you want to study, so if you are certain CS is it for you, it may be better to go there. Even full pay parents love a bargain, and will thank you for saving them money!  ```\n"
