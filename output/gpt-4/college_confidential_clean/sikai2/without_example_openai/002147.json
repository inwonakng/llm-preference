Also, congrats on being part of such a wonderful sport\u2026rowing. BTW, I am in the midst of reading \u201cThe Boys in the Boat\u201d. A friend recommended a few days ago. Both are great options\u2026academics, prestige. Having said that, you\u2019re right on with respect to this\u2026\u201cRowing, in winter, is not particularly pleasant as it\u2019s long months of indoor training which I would find at Princeton. At Stanford, we can be on the water all year round (sun!).\u201d.  If you spent most of your life rowing on the west-coast, it is a big adjustment to go east-coast (weather wise). Much bigger than wanting to experience another part of the country.  ```\n"
