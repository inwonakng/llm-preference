We are talking about the prestige of the schools here----the perception of MIT vs UM in the eyes of lay people, not CC readers. Since we don\u2019t know what OP is majoring we can only go by the general reputation of schools and how much it will help in OP\u2019s career.  Years from now employers will only know OP graduated from UM or MIT, not UM with full ride or MIT.  And they will have no idea how selective UM full ride is even if you try to tell them. IMHO, money can always be replaced but college name can never be; once its lost its lost forever.  ```\n"
