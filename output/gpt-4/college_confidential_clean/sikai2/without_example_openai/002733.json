Cornell Arts & Sciences and Michigan Ross will be VERY different experiences academically. Ross is very preprofessional. It\u2019s almost like an employee training program with some academics sprinkled in. If you double major with math, which is in LSA, you actually would be doing a dual degree, meaning that you would be graduating with a BBA from Ross and a BA (or BS?) in math. At Cornell Arts & Sciences you\u2019d be taking a more traditional course of study. It also has a lot of distribution requirements.  My recommendation is to make a spread sheet of the exact classes you\u2019d have to take (or requirements you\u2019d have to fulfill) every year at each college. Which looks more interesting? Which one gets you more excited? That will make the decision for you (outside of the financial aspect). Of course you can always go to Michigan and major in math there. You can minor in business at Ross if you want. There will be plenty of Wall St. opportunities with an undergrad math major.  ```\n"
