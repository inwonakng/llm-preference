Neither is \u201cbetter\u201d than the other, and neither will provide its graduates with better odds at success. McGill obviously has a stronger reputation globally. Few people outside of the Northeast have even heard of MHC. but where it really matters, among graduate school admissions committees and potential employers, I think the two are highly regarded. I would recommend going for fit. McGill is a large, urban, coeducational, public research university. MHC is small, private, rural-ish, women\u2019s liberal arts college. This is a fairly easy choice if you ask me. Where would intstudent2021 be happier?  ```\n"
