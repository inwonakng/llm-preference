Better athletics, better STEM/CS programs, better weather and it is an overall stronger university that provides the whole gamut of resources due to its strong grad schools. That said, if your heart is at Princeton for any reason (change of scenery, like he team/coach better etc) you should go for it. At this level the differences are small. Plus as you said Princeton\u2019s undergrad focus is amazing.  ```\n"
