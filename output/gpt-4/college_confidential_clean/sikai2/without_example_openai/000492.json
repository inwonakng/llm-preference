I have yet to meet a college student who says there isn\u2019t a lot of drinking on their campus - whether it is a big school, small school, rural, urban, etc. I have a friend whose daughter is a freshman at ND and her roommate is drinking four nights a week. The dorm is a party. My niece is a freshman at a big ten school. All kinds of drinking. I\u2019m guessing that, at most schools, students can choose to drink or not drink and it\u2019s their own choice. Both my friend\u2019s daughter and our niece have chosen to find like-minded kids in their classes and in club activities and they do not drink. But, yes, Kenyon is rural. Probably about as rural as they get. Lots of kids like that about rural LACs. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s figured out early on in most kids\u2019 searches if they like that kind of campus or not. We know two kids at Kenyon (both athletes). They don\u2019t drink, have tons of friends, and think the professors are out of this world.  ```\n"
