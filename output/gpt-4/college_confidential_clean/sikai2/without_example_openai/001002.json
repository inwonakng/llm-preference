No financial concerns where would you go, Harvard, Stanford or USC? And why? Now add finances back tot he equation. Assuming Harvard / Stanford is the choice, can you make it work without significant hardship on your lifestyle, retirement, etc? If so, great. If not, USC (which is also great) Big difference between \u201cshould I pay vs. could I pay?\u201d  If you\u2019re fortunate enough to be in the \u201cShould I pay\u201d group, really think about the \u201cwhy\u201d. If it\u2019s meaningful, pay, if not, don\u2019t.  ```\n"
