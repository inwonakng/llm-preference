If you haven\u2019t visited, I would get my skates on and visit before committing to a school ED- the cost of a quick trip will only be a fraction of the cost of a getting there & finding you aren\u2019t happy! @prezbucky\u2019s list is a good summary of \u2018usual suspects\u2019! There is a lot of applicant overlap between them. IMO, the crucial thing about these schools, which appeal to so many of the same kids, and which are similar in so many fundamental ways, actually do \u2018feel\u2019 very different (as you can see from the above posts). I knew- before my collegekid did- which of these schools she would end up choosing, b/c I saw how she responded to it, viscerally, at re-visit day. She hadn\u2019t even been that keen to go that day- she had already visited the school, done an overnight, sat in on a class, etc, and figured she knew pretty much all she needed to know (plus, it was the last of the re-visits & she was burning out). Her response to the day was just different than to the other schools: it was clear that she felt at home there, in a way that she had not at any of the other, pretty similar, schools. tl;dr: Go with your instincts- where did you feel most at home? Both schools are very campus-centric- that will be home for a long 4 years. Trust yourself.  ```\n"
