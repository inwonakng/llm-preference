Smaller classes, plenty of sections, geographically diversity, etc. [/quote]  CMU SCS computer science courses do not appear to be that small, according to the class schedule, which lists many of them with several discussion/recitation sections associated with a lecture: https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search . Students going into CS at a highly selective state flagship or private school known for CS should not be surprised that the popularity of the CS major means large classes.  Even places like Stanford and Harvard (700) and Harvey Mudd (200) have large class sizes for their introductory CS courses.  ```\n"
