So it\u2019d all depend on her/your certainty wrt small classes with little weedout (thanks to honors) but at a small campus (I think it\u2019s 4,000 students and not all live on campus) requiring the move to a larger campus after 2 years, or 4 years in the same place, with all the on campus life it entails but also the increased competition. However my gut feeling would be to go for VT, so that she can have the \u201cfull college experience\u201d. Do ask VT what sort of support they have for women in engineering: WISE? Living learning communities? Special adviser within engineering?  ```\n"
