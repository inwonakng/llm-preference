But only 57% would have done so in science and math. [/quote]  This is not, by the way, an argument for dropping the open curriculum at Amherst (or any other school). On the contrary, it\u2019s great that there are a variety of different LACs with different curricular options. I do think, though, that the open curriculum has certain consequences that are not widely appreciated. Ironically, it may lead to a curriculum that is actually narrow and \u201cclosed\u201d by traditional LAC standards. So while I am not arguing for change to the open curriculum, I am arguing for greater \u201copenness\u201d about it.  ```\n"
