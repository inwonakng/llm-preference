The sad fact (with everyone\u2019s facts) is the op was asking about engineering. I am sure he /she is running for cover or left this thread so everyone can compare that their bike is shiner then yours\u2026 I wish this thread would end but Feel compelled to state the obvious, Duke is a small Elite Private school that can take the cream of the crop applicants. I don\u2019t think they are taking lower Stat kids like public schools do in general. For engineering their program is very limited. I didn\u2019t even know they had a program but just went on their website. But if I wanted one of the programs they offered I am sure it\u2019s excellent. It\u2019s Duke\u2026 They don\u2019t have bad programs. As stated in my previous posts the opportunities at Michigan are ENDLESS. To the Op, Please pm me if you want more information. My son is going into engineering to get into finance /business management. He really likes the way engineering is taught and makes you think at a different level. Again as stated, he is going back to Michigan tomorrow to do a week long leadership Capstone for their $10,000 grant. They will work with mentors also over the summer to come up with a business plan going forward. It's the first time they took a freshman group and Michigan is paying for an airbnb for the 3 of them for the week to be there....... This is how Michigan supports their students endeavors! For those spitting out facts please read my two previous remarks in this thread. This is just one example of reality at Michigan that doesn\u2019t show up in the useless stats that are being stated. If you have the initiative and drive you will be successful at either institution.  ```\n"
