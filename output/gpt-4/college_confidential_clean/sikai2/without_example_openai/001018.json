Yes, both USC and Stanford would have several types. The proportions would differ. BTW, I\u2019m not using \u201cintellectual\u201d to stand in for \u201csuccessful\u201d or even \u201csmart\u201d. You can be both without being intellectual. Nor do I consider it to always be a positive (those who pursue the life of the mind may also be derided as eggheads). In any case, I\u2019m not sure this even matters to the OP, who seems much more pre-professionally focused than interested in pursuing a PhD, anyway.  ```\n"
