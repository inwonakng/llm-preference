The fact is, he\u2019ll take pretty much the same classes at UMD and be competitive for many of the same internships as CMU. And a year or two after graduation most employers won\u2019t care where he went to school, but rather what he accomplished at his last job. You can sweeten the idea of UMD by promising your son a great trip to Europe. (Even after paying for it, you\u2019ll have saved a fortune over CMU.)  ```\n"
