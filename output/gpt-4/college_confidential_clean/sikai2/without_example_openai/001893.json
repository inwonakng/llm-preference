They will not rescind your acceptance for asking questions. Going to Penn is your ticket to an upper-middle class life. It may be a bit intimidating at first, but that\u2019s OK. Clearly you are qualified. They would NEVER admit a student that was not qualified. You have to take the plunge. You won\u2019t regret it. Tell us a little about your background.  ```\n"
