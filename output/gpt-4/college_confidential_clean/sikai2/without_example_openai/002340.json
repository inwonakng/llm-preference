[/quote]  You will be able to get a job in any city after graduation with a degree from either, and recruiters from all the big companies will be on campus. I would say Michigan offers more opportunities.  [quote] Do most CS majors end up in grad school/ is that the smart move? [/quote]  Most CS majors do not go to grad school at all unless they are planning to go into research or academia. If you plan to work in the software/business world, you will only need a bachelors degree.  ```\n"
