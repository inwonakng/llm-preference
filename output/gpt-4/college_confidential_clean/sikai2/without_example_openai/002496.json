The Hoover Institute is there (but it is mostly conservative and I believe it mostly has application to grad students). [/quote]  Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institute has a great reputation, and while it may have a conservative reputation there are many liberal voices there as well. Michael McFaul is almost a regular on CNN. Also, while I\u2019m not completely clear on the depth of undergraduate offerings they support, the Hoover Institute hold a freshman class specifically for freshman. Small class size too    ```\n"
