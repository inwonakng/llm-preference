It\u2019s not at all obvious that Penn is stronger there. If you don\u2019t believe the Parchment data that somewhere between half and two-thirds of Penn-Yale cross-admits choose Yale, we\u2019re going to have to agree to disagree. And, assuming you accept that Yale wins on cross-admits, if you don\u2019t believe that a large chunk of what Penn gets is due to kids choosing Wharton\u2026again, we\u2019ll have a difference of opinion. I entirely agree that Penn is more pre-professional than Yale - that\u2019s why a lot of people turn it down. I know many - I would guess hundreds - of people who went to Penn; you\u2019re the first I\u2019ve met who I\u2019m aware turned down Yale to do so, but perhaps I should get out more.  ```\n"
