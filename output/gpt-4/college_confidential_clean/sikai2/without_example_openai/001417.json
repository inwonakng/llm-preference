They train your brain.  The risk of going to a school that trains for a job is that the skills you learn will become obsolete in ten years. Also no school is going to get you a job, let alone a high paying job.  That is up to you.  While there are certain majors that tend to pay more after graduation, the simple fact that you graduate in that major doesn\u2019t mean you will get a high paying job. I know it is difficult, but look at salary and compensation over the long run, not for the year after you graduate.  Try to figure out what you like to do.   Chances are you will make much more money over your career in a field that you love than in a relatively high paying field that you don\u2019t care for. This probably doesn\u2019t help choose a school.   Once you have determined the financial aid angle, how about choosing the school you like the best. ```\n"
