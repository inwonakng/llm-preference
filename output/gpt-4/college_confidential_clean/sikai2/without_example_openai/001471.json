Your having to switch jobs isn\u2019t ideal though. Even if jobs are plentiful, the problem isn\u2019t finding  job, it\u2019s finding a good, stable job with good pay and benefits. Is your current job portable? Does your company have branches in the Columbus area? Are you sure you have to move? Could you plan with the college\u2019s health system, set up a plan for her so that she\u2019s checked regularly by a doctor recommended by her hospital or knows what to do?  ```\n"
