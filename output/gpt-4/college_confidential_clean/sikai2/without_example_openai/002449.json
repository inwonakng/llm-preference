Tons of concerts and sporting events and clubs and things of that nature.  A good local theater group (Syracuse Stage) and beautiful proscenium theater (The Landmark). The Dome, despite it\u2019s ugliness, has many premier events.  Few things are more fun than a packed SU basketball game! Like many big colleges, the University Union is well funded and always has something going on.  I was very involved with it and saw everything free! lol Films, Concerts, Speakers, etc. http://www.universityunion.syr.edu/ Because of the weather SU is big on what I will refer to as \u201cindoor sports\u201d.  Marshall street is where the bars/restaurants are, but it is essentially on campus.  You\u2019ll run into everyone there.  The Varsity is the most famous local beer/pizza/wings joint but there are many. http://varsitysyracuse.com/.  And of course Dinosaur BBQ. I had an excellent time there and was very involved in stuff, although it was long ago.  Campus is great, weather is awful\u2026 all the things you hear are true.  But the city of Syracuse, which I have an affinity for, is not what I would call a \u201cgreat college town\u201d. But you will not be bored. Good luck!  ```\n"
