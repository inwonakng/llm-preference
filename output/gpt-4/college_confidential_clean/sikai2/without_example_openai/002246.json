If you\u2019re paying sticker price, then UofM would make more sense if you\u2019re considering the technical skills you\u2019ll learn as a CS major. Also, do you want to stay in Michigan long-term? If so, Mich places more of their graduates instate than Columbia would. Columbia, however, will give you better OCR opportunities in San Fran/NYC and an, arguably, stronger lifelong network. Also, agreed with @fivesages that Columbia gives you alternate paths if your career plans change\u2013consulting, banking, etc.  ```\n"
