Here\u2019s a map. http://www.thevillageclaremont.com/map.html. I\u2019m tagging @nostalgicwisdom for more feedback. I will say that the Pomona CS Department is struggling with the same issues as HMC\u2019s, which is demand that exceeds the amount of faculty available. Basically you have to be a CS major to have the necessary priority to get in classes. They will hold spaces in the introductory classes for the incoming freshmen, but after that you\u2019d better declare a CS major asap. My D is an Econ major who is trying to complete a CS minor and she was shut out of the class she wanted last Spring semester as a junior. Generally cross-registration is easy and seamless but be aware that for your major some departments will require that you complete certain courses at Pomona (e.g., the Econ department requires that you take the 6 core classes for the major at Pomona). My D is currently doing an internship one of the Federal Reserve Banks. She\u2019s only been there a few days but her boss, a senior Research Economist at the Fed, told her that she is on the \u201cright tail\u201d in terms of the amount of research experience that his interns have had.  ```\n"
