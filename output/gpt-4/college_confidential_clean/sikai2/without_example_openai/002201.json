The Ivies came to an agreement about how much they would lower their standards for Athletes.  Other elite privates that participate at the Division I level like Stanford, Duke, Notre Dame, Vanderbilt, etc only operate under their own standards and the NCAA\u2019s.  While Stanford does an admirable job keeping standards high they nonetheless make extensive exceptions for Athletes to be able to participate in their sport at the highest level and still maintain satisfactory academic progress toward a degree.  The by product is the ability to find less rigorous courses and majors.  ```\n"
