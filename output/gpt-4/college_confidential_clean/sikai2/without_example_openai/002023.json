UT Austin is urban with a VERY diverse student body. It appeared to me to be way more diverse than IU or SMU. From what I\u2019ve gathered, the business school ranks much higher than SMU and slightly higher than IU. However, it\u2019s a very big campus and most of the kids are from Texas who attend. SMU is a beautiful campus in downtown Dallas, but it definitely had the feel of being more \u201ccampus-like\u201d to me than UT. I\u2019ve heard it is more preppy with an upper middle class/ \u201cwealthier\u201d status attached to it, but I didn\u2019t see a ton of that. IU has a beautiful college campus and the Kelley school is phenomenal as well. I\u2019ve heard employers love to hire Kelley kids. I believe most of the IU kids get jobs in Chicago or Midwest area. You mentioned a concern about rigor at SMU and Kelley. Did you mean that the programs might be TOO rigorous? Just wondering what you have heard or read about that.  ```\n"
