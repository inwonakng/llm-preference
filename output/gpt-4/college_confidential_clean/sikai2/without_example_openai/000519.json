Visited class, met with students or faculty in activities/departments of interest? What we are saying is: both are great schools, a lot of overlap in culture. Vassar can be accessible to NYC and the eastern seaboard, which can be a plus for some, while Kenyon is very much a self-contained residential community, which is part of its charm for others. Vassar does not have a history of football or greek life, whereas Kenyon has several teams that are ranked nationally in the top 10 and which hope to win a national championship, including swimming and diving and Men\u2019s soccer, and it has greek life. If you felt a deeper connection to one, after full visits, then go with your heart.  ```\n"
