Cross off Georgia tech. Great school but attracts some of the best stem minds in the country. Too liberal.  Not sure  what too liberal means. That\u2019s personal and the line isn\u2019t clearly defined. In the words of my liberal d17 after the Wesleyan tour day. She thought it had an activist vibe that didn\u2019t appeal to her.  But to each his own. I never went there. Hamilton based on my direct observations and dear friends current legacies at Hamilton it maybe just what you are looking for. Smart kids. Good profs but perhaps a bit ore mainstream than the other two. Just y two cents. And Wesleyan grads and parents please don\u2019t shoot the messenger. It\u2019s a top top school and I know all about lin manual and my idol Bill Belichick  ```\n"
