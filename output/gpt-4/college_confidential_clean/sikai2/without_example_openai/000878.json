BU is now more selective than BC based on acceptance rate, and draws a nearly identical student body as BC based on stats, which wasn\u2019t the case a few years ago. It\u2019s also catching up and will probably surpass BC in the overall U.S. news rankings in the near future. BU\u2019s been really ramping up it\u2019s STEM offerings, and it looks like that\u2019s paying off.  ```\n"
