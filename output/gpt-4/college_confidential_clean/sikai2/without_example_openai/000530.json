But overall absolutely loves it and is also driven by social justice issues. And she is from Manhattan and they rarely go into the City. So much going on for her. But perhaps others do more regularly. I wouldn\u2019t know. I have no insight into Kenyon but it sounds fantastic too. Drinking culture is pretty much everywhere. I think the school releasing a report and putting a light on it, probably has had a positive impact. It\u2019s quite honorable they placed principals above negative reaction.  ```\n"
