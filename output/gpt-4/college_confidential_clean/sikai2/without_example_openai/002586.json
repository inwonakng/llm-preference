We ended our campus visit to Amherst with plans to never look back, so submitting an application to Amherst was never a consideration. Our daughter is a happy freshman at Carleton (prospective Bio major) who applied only RD to all her college choices. Your son either does not have a good enough of a feel for both of the colleges or else he is over intellectualizing the decision process, in my view. His gut feeling (once he is fully informed) should be his guide.  ```\n"
