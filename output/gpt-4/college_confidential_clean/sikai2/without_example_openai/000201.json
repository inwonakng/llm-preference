They are all very large as well.  One has more winter, one is in the mountains and one has more seasons.  I attended NC State and have visited the others.  VaT is the prettiest campus, with the Hokie Stone buildings and mountain back drop.  NCSU Centennial Campus is very nice too and is where most of your engineering classes will be.  Be sure to check out the Hunt Library when you visit.  PSU campus is huge and very traditional (in a good way).  I went to a white-out game!  Had a great time. Raleigh/Triangle will have more opportunity and more things to do in the area. Visit and see which one feels the best.  ```\n"
