There are hiking trails that leave from campus and a lovely 380 acre bird-sanctuary literally across the street. Bates has a private 600 acre nature preserve, the Bates-Morse Mountain Conservation Area, with beaches, salt marshes and woodland. Bates also has a famous Outing Club and a sailing club. Many kids engage in winter sports. I am not an expert, but from what I have gleaned over the years, Bates is probably the most laid-back of the three. Having said all this, I am biased because my D attends:-).  ```\n"
