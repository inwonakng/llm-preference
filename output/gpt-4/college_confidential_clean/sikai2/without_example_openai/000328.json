It\u2019s just a percentage of total addimision. Penn State is another one.  They\u2019ve admitted students this current admission cycle to the main University Park campus with substantially lower stats than a lot of business and engineering pre-majors with higher stats. Instead, PSU pushed those kids off to branch campuses.  And the expection is that if you want to attend, don\u2019t count on any aid.  ```\n"
