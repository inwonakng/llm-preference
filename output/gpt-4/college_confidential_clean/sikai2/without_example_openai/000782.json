I was a science major in another department, so I can speak about research at Pomona. It\u2019s easy to get involved- you can start from the moment you arrive on campus! I started in the second semester of my first year. The intro courses do a good job connecting you with the department so you can learn about each professor\u2019s research interests and see where you want to build experience. You mentioned an interest in AI, so here\u2019s a perspective from a recent grad to see her CS experiences both in and outside Pomona: http://www.pomona.edu/news/2018/03/22-chinasa-okolo-%E2%80%9918-coding-more-inclusive-computer-science During the school year, you do research as a course- in your case, either CS199RAPO (Research Assistantship) or CS199IRPO (Independent Research). I believe there are some funds available for students who need work-study money as well. These are courses you create which are advised by a professor. Grad schools love these because it shows independence and direct research involvement. There\u2019s also a game lab at CGU: http://www.cgu.edu/center/claremont-game-lab/ Most upper-division labs at Pomona are structured to involve an independent research project. The work I did in two of my labs (required courses at Pomona!) was presented in research conferences, and one was turned into a paper. During the summer, there are three opportunities you can use. Summer Undergrad Research Program, SURP, pays $440 per week and funds about ~200 students to engage with research with professors on-campus. An additional 30-50 projects are funded for off-campus unpaid research opportunities or independent proposals. Pomona College Summer Experience Funding (SEF) is done through the Career Development Office and funds unpaid or low-paying internships (you come up with the budget); I benefited from that to do research at a major university. Harvey Mudd sponsors a 5C summer research program in CS which sponsors 70 students for research: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/research/ This isn\u2019t as difficult to benefit from as it sounds, since the vast majority of CS students across the colleges do an internship over the summer rather than staying on campus. Thesis is optional for CS at Pomona, but highly encouraged if you want to go to grad school. You can do an academic thesis (with independent research) advised by a CS professor at either Pomona or Mudd- there\u2019s an agreement between the two schools to combine professor expertise in order to manage thesis led research proposals. As seen above, Chinasa did her senior project with a Pomona professor. The alternative is Clinic, in which you are given an industry project by a company and work in teams to come up with solutions/insights. You can learn more about Clinic here (http://www.cs.hmc.edu/clinic/info) and see specific projects here (https://www.cs.hmc.edu/clinic/projects/). I counted 9 people from my class in the link for 2015-2016.  ```\n"
