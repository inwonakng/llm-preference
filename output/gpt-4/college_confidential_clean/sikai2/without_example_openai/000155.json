What do the net price calculators of the other schools you are waiting for estimate? How do those numbers compare to what you and your parents can actually pay?  (Note that you can only borrow $5,500 first year without a cosigner.) Based on what you wrote above, it looks like lowest cost will be the main factor in your college choice (if any are affordable at all).  ```\n"
