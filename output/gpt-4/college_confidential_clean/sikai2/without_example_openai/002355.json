Since SV hires more people from SJS? Meg Whitman, Jeff Bezos, Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates attended schools in what athletic conference? None of them wen to Columbia, they want to Harvard and Princeton, which is a different discussion.  For UM vs Columbia for Computer Science, Michigan is better all around in terms of prestige, campus feel, cutting edge research etc\u2026  Harvard vs Michigan or Princeton for CS is different, I\u2019ll grant that.  ```\n"
