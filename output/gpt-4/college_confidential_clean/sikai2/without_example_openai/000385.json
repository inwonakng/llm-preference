We live even closer\u202615 miles and if my son decides to attend, I\u2019d want him on campus. However, my biggest fear is that it will be deserted on weekends, he won\u2019t have that true \u2018college\u2019 experience, and as he puts it, he\u2019ll feel like it\u2019s an extension of high school. In two weeks we are having second looks at some other schools he had been accepted at and hope he sees the benefits of those programs as well.  ```\n"
