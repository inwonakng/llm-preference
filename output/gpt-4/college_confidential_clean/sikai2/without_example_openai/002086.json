If they haven\u2019t been able to save $80,000 for school, how do you expect them to repay that kind of money plus interest? It appears to me that your resources are a ~$5900 Pell Grant + the $5500 student loan. That\u2019s ~$11k. Do you have any schools whose net cost is within your budget? Look carefully at the packages to make sure they\u2019re not already counting Pell and the loan. Are there affordable schools in your home state of CA? Will you get any state grants if you attend one of them?  ```\n"
