I don\u2019t see that as a problem as this is done at the high school level with many varsity sports.  He practices pretty much year round five days a week. The fall is a bit lighter in intensity than in winter and onward. Many of his teammates including him are stem majors. As for taking some \u2018easy\u2019 classes, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s limited to athletes.  I remember choosing some classes based on \u2018easy\u2019 status because I worked part time and had other non academic commitments.  My point is that OP should choose his major based on what he loves and would want to pursue as a career, not what will accommodate his sport or be easy to get a degree in because his sport keeps him too busy.  ```\n"
