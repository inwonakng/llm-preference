But on the multiple dining options at Hamilton perhaps being a reflection of greater financial resources, I don\u2019t think that is a finances thing.  On our Bates visit, I recall hearing that there was a concerted effort to consider whether to build additional dining options around campus, and with student support, the decision was it was an important part of campus culture that the community came together in a single dining hall throughout the day.  ```\n"
