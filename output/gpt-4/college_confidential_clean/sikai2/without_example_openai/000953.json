Honestly and politely  I am not sure how much more needs to be said.  2.2 million students per year in US plus thousands of international student apply to us schools each year.  If there are 40k spots in the top 25 for the US portion of the pool  that\u2019s means only the top 18 percent get in. And now take out legacies athletes and urm it\u2019s even a smaller pool. USC is in that pool. The other big names definitely rank higher and have higher prestige among the people in the pool with them. But very few people care but the other people in the pool with you. USC is 70k per year times four years. They are giving you a free house. He has earned the great reward. Enjoy it.  ```\n"
