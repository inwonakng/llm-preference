However, I don\u2019t know anyone who studied in the faculty of arts. \u201caren\u2019t the colleges aware of the system followed in Canada/McGill?\u201d To some extent yes. The last time that I looked (several years ago) McGill didn\u2019t even publish the GPAs of students that they accepted into medical school. I suspected (but never found any real information) that this was because they understood how hard they themselves grade in premed, and adjust for it. I doubt that other schools fully adjust for it however.  ```\n"
