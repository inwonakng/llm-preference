Substitute the word \u201ccollege\u201d for \u201cnew car.\u201d  Which one would you take? A 60k BMW at 5% interest you can\u2019t really afford anyway, or a new Honda Accord for free?  You\u2019re going to be better off financially taking the free car.  Now, you mentioned medical school.  That\u2019s going to be a lot of money in loans, and you\u2019ll have a major advantage going into med school debt free.  ```\n"
