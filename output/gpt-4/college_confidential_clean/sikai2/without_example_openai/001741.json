Ummmm, no. Think about it this way\u2026 how many students attend the elite elites: HYPMS? Let\u2019s round that off to maybe 8000 students. And to be fair, we\u2019re not talking about full-rides just anywhere\u2026 but full-rides to top schools (say, top 50 on USNWR) outside the elite elite. You think there are that many full-rides out there at top schools? I find it amusing that folks think a full-ride scholarship to a fantastic school like Michigan is just so blas\u00e9 that anyone at HYPSM could have gotten it and turned it down.  ```\n"
