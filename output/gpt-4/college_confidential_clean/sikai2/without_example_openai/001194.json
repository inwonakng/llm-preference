Big city in China could mean a lot of things.  Beijing and Shanghai are way different.  My wife\u2019s home city in China is has a population of 6 million but it\u2019s not that cosmopolitan in comparison to Beijing/Shanghai (it\u2019s a Northeastern rust belt dump of a city). If the OP is used to \u2018big city life\u2019 so to speak, Maine is going to be a major cultural shock.  Even St. Louis is way more different than most American cities.  It\u2019s not as rushed as San Francisco/Los Angeles/New York. WashU has an active Chinese students association.  Also if you\u2019re not used to Western food, there are better options to get Asian groceries in St. Louis than heading to a Chinese grocery in Boston every other weekend.  ```\n"
