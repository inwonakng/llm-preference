The classes are giant (Intro to CS is the largest lecture in the nation with over 1000 students) and they rely heavily on TAs for instruction. The campus is amoeboid with pretty parts, but no clear edges. I guess it\u2019s all very personal. They do place CS grads into great jobs and the graduate school is one of the best in the world.  ```\n"
