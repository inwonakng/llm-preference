Do you want to live on the East Coast or the West Coast?  If the East Cost, north or south?  Do you want to live in an environment that has you near Silicon Valley or not?  The good news is you really can\u2019t go wrong on the education front.  I\u2019d be cautious of CS ranking placement for undergraduate studies.  My son fell into that trap, and found out that at the undergraduate level it is either good school or not good school.  For your choices nobody would argue which category these three fall.  You live in MA, do you want to see your home often during the school year, either you visiting home or home visiting you?  Do you like the NE and could live nowhere else?  Are you open to a new adventure?  Notice, none of my questions have to do with academics, it is all about what makes you you.  ```\n"
