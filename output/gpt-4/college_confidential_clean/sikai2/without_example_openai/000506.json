In the Midwest, Oberlin, Grinnell, and Kenyon come to mind \u2013 Oberlin and Kenyon for strength in music/humanities and Grinnell for vibe: liberal but friendly, not militant. But all three are in very small towns that would feel much more rural than Poughkeepsie. Macalester might be similar in some ways, and it is in a city \u2013 a big city. But it would feel more urban than Vassar. Carleton maybe? But it isn\u2019t really known for outstanding humanities, though being a top LAC kind of implies strength in them. Carleton is liberal but not militant, pretty friendly and down to earth, and 30-45 minutes from a big city. Northfield has a population of about 20000 (vs. Poughkeepsie\u2019s ~30000). St. Olaf has more of a humanities-rich feel than Carleton.  ```\n"
