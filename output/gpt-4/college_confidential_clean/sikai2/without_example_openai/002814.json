I used that example, an uncommon one for me, along with Stanford, out of convenience. Earlier I\u2019d thought you may have sincerely asked for opinions as to whether you will find meaningful academic differences between your choices (based on rankings or other factors). As to whether standardized scoring profiles, as an indicator, may reflect the actual classroom experience, my own response was \u201cMaybe.\u201d I meant that quite literally, as in I really don\u2019t know, simultaneously, how the students at both Hamilton and Bates engage with their academics.  ```\n"
