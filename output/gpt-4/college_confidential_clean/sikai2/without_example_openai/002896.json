JHU\u2019s average GPA across the campus is a 3.35. Is that major grade deflation? Is Cornell\u2019s \u201cnowhere near that bad\u201d? Where do you pull this stuff. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Since you\u2019re a JHU undergrad, can you share more about your perspective?  Are you premed? we do hear that premed is a grind at JHU, but maybe it\u2019s not worse than any other school. Whether a school is known for grade deflation or grade inflations isn\u2019t really relevant except if the student is premed.  Schools that have grade inflation still heavily weed the premed prereqs.  ```\n"
