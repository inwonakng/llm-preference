[/quote]  Lots of students want to continue their sport in college, and compete at the DIII level because it is something they love and are good at.  I think it is perfectly legitimate to want to swim in college.  BUT\u2026 I do agree that having it as a driver for where to apply is maybe short sighted.  As @Corbett says, neither is ideal for what the OP wants.  Honestly, I suspect it would be grueling to keep the needed GPA for med school at Amherst as well (not quite as much as Mudd, but still super challenging \u2013 not much time for anything but sport and studying).  I also think Swarthmore is a risky choice \u2013 again, VERY difficult academically (my kid picked Mudd over Swat, but liked both because she wanted the highest level of academic intensity she could find).  I wouldn\u2019t pick a top 5 LAC in general to do a sport and pre-med \u2013 stiff competition for the grades you need there.  ```\n"
