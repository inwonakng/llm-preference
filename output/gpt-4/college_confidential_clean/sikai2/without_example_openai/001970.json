The EECS at Berkeley is NOT cutthroat. Far from it. EECS students are used to do team-working. It\u2019s a highly collaborative environment where everyone is helping each other out. The College of Engineering students rarely complain, if at all they do, about the lack of resources dedicated to undergrad students. It\u2019s also not true advising is lacking. You\u2019ll get plenty of it there. And, Berkeley being less diverse than Duke? Really? That\u2019s new to me. I\u2019ve been to many top-ranked schools and I have yet to see a school with a more diverse student body than Berkeley\u2019s. I have no idea how Duke takes care of its students. But Berkeley COE environment is top-class.  [quote] and generally, the student population is not as intellectual. [/quote]  This is another myth. Can you show us any data to support this? Only 8% get into the College of Engineering, less than 8% in the College of Chemistry. And, less than 6% get onto EECS. I would love to see any data that would show Duke\u2019s student body is more intellectual than Berkeley College of Engineering student body.  ```\n"
