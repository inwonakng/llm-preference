You can go to a large State school and find plenty of rigorous courses but you can also \u2018slide\u2019 much easier.  Stanford\u2019s not going to have that low of a floor but it\u2019s floor is going to be lower than schools like MIT, Chicago, Cal Tech and even Princeton.  Most likely doesn\u2019t matter much for this applicant.  ```\n"
