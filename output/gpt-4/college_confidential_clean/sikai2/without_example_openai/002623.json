Yale\u2019s residential system (which, as @renaissancedad says,most people would say is one of Yale\u2019s crown jewels and unique strengths) is arguably the best for the average college student who isn\u2019t certain going in what they want to study and isn\u2019t looking to spend most of their time with other people in their chosen program (I believe upwards of two-thirds of Yale students change their intended major). The idea is that living with a variety of people studying various things, in a smaller community (the residential college, which you\u2019re affiliated with whether or not you live in it as a freshman), is part of your education. Penn is a much more pre-professional environment, and that\u2019s what some students undoubtedly prefer and thrive in.  ```\n"
