Just to clarify, Michigan Law accepts a lot of people from its undergrad, but that is because they are residents of the State of Michigan, not because they went to U of M.  There is a preference for in-state students, and they always make up about 20 percent of the law school class.   You don\u2019t become a resident by going to the U of M as an undergrad, so I\u2019m not sure that an out of state student would have any admissions advantage by having gone there. I suspect that UVa is the same.  ```\n"
