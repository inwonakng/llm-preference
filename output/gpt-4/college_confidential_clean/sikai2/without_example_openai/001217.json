That said, I would ask in the Bowdoin forum, or simply google \u201ctop restaurants in Brunswick, ME\u201d and check out what the town offers. Off the top of my head:  St. Louis will have better ribs. It is also known for pizza, but good pizza can be found in many environs. Brunswick will have fresh lobster, lobster rolls, seafood in general. I\u2019m not much of a fan of seafood, but I loved the lobster rolls in Maine. It\u2019s like a lighter/flakier, richer version of chicken salad.   ```\n"
