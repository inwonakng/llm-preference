Every school has easier courses available - there aren\u2019t any athletes taking the Integrated Science Curriculum with my D but there are in her Psych 101 class - but maybe due to size and less grade inflation fewer at Princeton.  Also there\u2019s no ducking that Senior Thesis requirement.  Basically the rigor floor is lower at Stanford which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. That\u2019s not a statement about the rigor ceiling which obviously at school like Stanford is as high as the student desires.  ```\n"
