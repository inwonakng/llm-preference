I\u2019m looking for something a little bit more laid back. [/quote]  I would question whether there is really any discernible difference between Bowdoin, Midd, and Williams on the \u201claid-back vs. cut-throat\u201d scale.  Williams might have slightly higher stats, but not by much. Bates might be a little further towards the laid-back end of the scale.  [quote] Bowdoin or Bates would offer more non outdoorsy activities than Midd. That is in part due to locatIon. [/quote]  This is a point where there actually would be a discernible difference. Williamstown MA is even smaller than Middlebury VT, and offers even fewer non-outdoorsy activities. Williams is arguably at the far end of the \u201coutdoor vs. indoor activities\u201d scale.  ```\n"
