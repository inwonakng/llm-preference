Masters programs usually are not. MBA programs may have scholarships but full-rides to top MBA programs are almost non-existent. As for the 529 money, yes it is budgeted for education, but parents can withdraw an amount equal to the scholarship penalty-free. As I said, even if that money doesn\u2019t have to be used for the parents\u2019 retirement, after 40 years (when this kid retires), you can expect that amount to be around $2M in today\u2019s dollars. Yes, fit matters (though it seems like the OP likes UMich more socially anyway), but from an ROI standpoint, this is a no-brainer.  ```\n"
