And I certainly did not intend that either. It\u2019s just that he clearly prefers Ann Arbor. Which he only pointed out in reaction to your post on the topic.  Having visited, I can understand why. However I will continue to vacation in Ithaca, Not Ann Arbor. Someone forget to send me the \u201ceasily outgrown\u201d memo, because I still love Ithaca. We all tend to identify mostly with our undergrad alma maters, anyway. Not everybody loves Ithaca as much as I do, but most people find it at least \u201cgood enough\u201d, as a backdrop for their college years. There may be differences,  but f I were OP I would not let one of these college towns vs. the other drive his decision.  ```\n"
