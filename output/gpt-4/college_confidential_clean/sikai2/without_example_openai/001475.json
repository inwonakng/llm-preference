PhD programs\u2019 sensitivity to school prestige (in major) appears to vary by subject. Law school is mostly about college GPA and LSAT score.  See http://lawschoolnumbers.com . Medical schools tend to first screen by college GPA and MCAT score, then holistic review considers many factors, including pre-med extracurriculars, interview, etc\u2026  You may want to ask more in the pre-med forum section. Unfortunately, UCSD\u2019s career survey is not very informative: https://career.ucsd.edu/alumni/alumni-survey/index.html Kenyon has some information at http://www.kenyon.edu/after-kenyon/graduate-schools-and-preprofessional-programs/ .  ```\n"
