Williams wouldn\u2019t even be ranked and Dartmouth is ranked extremely lowly by ARWU, for instance. A school like IU who\u2019s strengths are in business, music, and dance (and doesn\u2019t even offer engineering) would not do well in that ranking. But how much does a heavily STEM-based research ranking tell you about Kelley undergrad? I used the Forbes subrankings because they have a ranking of \u201cAmerican Leaders\u201d, per capita student awards, and per capita PhDs. I can\u2019t find those alumni achievement rankings elsewhere. Graduation rate mostly tells you how strong (and wealthy) entering students are. Salary is heavily influenced by major (and the mix of majors differs a lot; IU doesn\u2019t have engineering; RPI and GTech offer almost no majors outside of STEM). The elite professional school ranking is from a WSJ Feeder ranking from years back. I\u2019ll try to find it.  ```\n"
