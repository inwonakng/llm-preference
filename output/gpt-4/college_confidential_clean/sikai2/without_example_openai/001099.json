I had this conversation back then with him about USC scholarship vs Stanford.  I am an SC alum that\u2019s why :).  Told him if he got scholarship from SC he should go there (he is a science/math kid who loves to dance).  So that\u2019s our value.  Each family have their own values. Well things do not go as planned.  He decided he wanted to pursue dance (together with bio) so now USC dance program became his #1 choice. Like film school, it\u2019s extremely hard to get in.  He is wait listed at USC dance and we are looking to put down deposit at Stanford (bio).  He is not a super \u201cintellectual\u201d kid as his friends who got full tuition scholarship at USC or Regents Scholarships from UC\u2019s, but he is one of the kindest and most passionate and hardworking kids I know.  We are very grateful Stanford saw that and accepted him.  Majors/interests are probably more important in considerations and as of now, he would go to USC regardless of scholarship.  ```\n"
