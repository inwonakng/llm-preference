(Ultimately ended up at another school due to WL.) She did not consider applying to Vassar. Personally, while Vassar was lovely, I did think it felt extremely monied. Make no mistake, there are rich kids at both colleges. My thought is that Kenyon is relaxed and creative. The professors are HIGHLY regarded and consistently hold several spots in Princeton Review\u2019s Best Prof list. Students really enjoy classes. I felt that Vassar is a little overly-earnest and artificial. But they are both excellent colleges and it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that many students like them both.  ```\n"
