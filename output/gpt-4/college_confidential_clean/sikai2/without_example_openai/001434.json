In all seriousness, though, I have Cornell up there primarily because their academic rep seems to be pretty strong across the board, similar to NU and Duke. They aren\u2019t as selective, but my tiers aren\u2019t looking at that too much \u2013 they\u2019re based mostly on perceived academic quality/rep and endowment (the ability to spend money to benefit students\u2026).  ```\n"
