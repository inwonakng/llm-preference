A Duke engineering degree will open doors for you. But Berkeley is in a whole different league. Berkeley competes only with two other great schools in this regard \u2013 Stanford and MIT. Duke, sad to say, just isn\u2019t in their league yet. So, let\u2019s not try to confuse people on here and letting them believe Duke engineering degree carries much more clout and prestige than a Berkeley engineering degree. It is a complete reverse.  ```\n"
