However, you have had a much fresher experience there, and may be susceptible to some degree of confirmation bias as you assimilate new information. I\u2019d suggest you keep an open mind through your upcoming visit to Hamilton. At that point you can make a fair choice. To close a door now, though, because of the seemingly rapidly impending decision you must make, would be premature \u2013 you have come too far for that.  ```\n"
