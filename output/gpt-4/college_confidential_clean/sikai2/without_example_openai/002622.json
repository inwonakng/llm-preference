I would suggest staying on point. @sheilsarda wrote:  [quote] My main concern with yale and Penn respectively, is Yale\u2019s residential college system forcing me to stay with random roommates for a year who\u2019ll probably not be in my major given how small engineering is,and at Penn, it\u2019s the extreme rigor and workload of the program creating a toxic environment that discourages friendship and collaboration. [/quote]  Most people consider the residential colleges to be one of the strongest points about Yale.  They tend to foster a great sense of community, and make the university more accessible.  Freshmen are generally undeclared, and the majority of them are not physically housed in the residential college itself (depending on the college), so you would almost certainly be with \u201crandom roommates we\u2019ll probably not be in my major\u201d.  Many students change prospective majors.  All of that is part of the experience of being at a school with a strong liberal arts focus. I\u2019m a huge fan of Penn\u2019s dual degree programs, for the right students.  Those students are usually very focused and motivated, and are ready to jump in from day 1.  If you know you want to combine engineering and entrepreneurship, and like the idea of being with a elite cohort of similar students, it\u2019s hard to beat M&T.   The program will certain have extreme rigor and a heavy workload, but I don\u2019t get the sense that most people find the environment toxic. Both are amazing schools, but very different experiences (especially with M&T factored in).  I would think it depends on whether you want a more focused, intense experience in your subjects of interest with a lot of resources and a program tailored to your interests, or a broader, more liberal arts based experience, where you will have to carve out your own path. I hope this helps.  ```\n"
