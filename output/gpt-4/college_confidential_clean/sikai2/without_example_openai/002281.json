      "content": "College A: ```Columbia University```\nCollege B: ```University of Michigan```\nComment: ```Much2learn, salary surveys are never accurate. For one, they seldom adjust for cost of living. As you can see from the link you provided, most of the universities at the top are concentrated in California and the East Coast, where the cost of living is significantly higher than the cost of living in the Midwest and the South. Besides, the figures are suspect to begin with. For example, the average starting salary for CS majors at Michigan is close to $100k, so I am not sure how it is possible  for the \u201cearly career pay\u201d to be $75k. Like I said above, last year, roughly one third of Michigan\u2019s CS majors landed jobs with Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. That\u2019s tangible evidence of the program\u2019s status as one of the better CS departments in the country. Columbia will likely have similar placement success, but at a fraction of the cost, the OP is probably better off foregoing Columbia and sticking to his in-state option.  ```\n"
