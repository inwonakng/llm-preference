On that basis, Richmond would be better option. In terms of access to an exchange program with LSE \u2013 exchange programs with Oxford, Cambridge and, presumably, LSE, are usually very competitive for students applying to visit from US schools \u2013 the students we know who were admitted to the Oxford study abroad program were the \u201ccream of the crop\u201d at their respective universities. I tend to think that being a big deal scholarship recipient at Richmond would create more opportunities for research, leadership and other skills which would maximize acceptance into a competitive admissions study abroad such as LSE. You said a tolerant community is important to you \u2013 and Haverford certainly meets that. But the other reasons you said you liked Haverford \u2013 its location and the opportunity to take classes at Penn (which does NOT include Wharton) does not seem like a strong reason to prefer Haverford. As I said, I\u2019m a BiCo community member, I think Haverford is an amazing school.  ```\n"
