So this very lucky kid should go to where this kid wants to go. Which is probably Columbia. [/quote]  It\u2019s nowhere near that simple. The strength of preference is an important consideration, as is where the 180K goes if they do not spend it. If I as the student got to keep that 180K for post-grad to invest or buy a house or a car or get ahead in various ways financially, Columbia is in no way worth it. If that 180K means my parents can retire two or three years earlier, that\u2019s a consideration as well. It\u2019s a conversation to have with them.  [quote] The kid expresses a clear preference for the Columbia \u201cexperience\u201d over the nearby State U \u201cexperience\u201d (even though the State U here is one of the best state Us there is). [/quote]  I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re getting this strong strength of preference which you have been using as part of your argument all thread. The quotes below are the only mentions of preference in the thread by the OP:  [quote] I prefer Columbia but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the additional $180,000. [/quote]   [quote] NYC definitely has that extra appeal to me but the money of course is a huge drawback. [/quote]  Not to mention that the OP originally mentions going to grad school. You also keep insisting price is not important when the OP explicitly states that it is a factor for them.  All of this also ignores the possibility that Michigan for CS could be the better choice in a vacuum for some students, possibly this one, given the additional information in this thread (unfortunately buried in tangents).  Hunt\u2019s analysis does indeed lay it out well. While very helpful, it doesn\u2019t answer the question for this specific case.  ```\n"
