So it really depends on exactly what type of engineer you want to become, as to whether Caltech is a good fit.  Caltech is more of a chemistry, math and physics focused school, but the math will prepare students for a career in fluid mechanics for instance.  Thats the science that describes how an airplane moves through the air , the air being a \u201cfluid\u201d. For an undergrad in BME, the chemistry at Caltech, might be compelling, but I would say JHU, Caltech or GaTech are about the same for BME.   Maybe GaTech a tad better, IF the student wants to design prosthesis, the best artificial heart, etc, because GaTech has such a tight relationship with Emory U Medical and has arguably very good mechanical engineering training. All BMEs are going to get more education. So its also a personal preference, does the student  want hot dry Pasadena, a small town, with great access to Los Angeles, or the big bustling city of Atlanta, with sports, hiking, rock climbing close by, or the sailing and crab cakes  that Baltimore offers, with access to Washington DC?  ```\n"
