But SOMETIMES athletic recruits are in the lower end of the applicant pool in terms of test scores and or grades.  They are hooked, so can get a slight edge there.  If the OP falls in that category, honestly, and wants to get the grades needed for med school, it might not be the best choice to be competing against (1) students with somewhat higher academic qualifications, and (2) students who don\u2019t have the same commitment to a time intensive EC. I suspect it is easier at Amherst than Mudd. https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=students-study-most This isn\u2019t an exaggeration.  My kid worked insanely hard just to pass her classes there.  No way could she have stacked a sport on top of it (and her GPA was still not med-school worthy).  Her friends who were athletes really struggled to keep up, too.  Mudd is a great school.  But it is not a great place for pre-meds to start with. Most schools have some students in premed who don\u2019t do much but study.  There is something to be said for going to a slightly easier school if that is you chosen path so you can keep the needed GPA.  ```\n"
