I have two small college athletes and have been through this process.  That can cause a lot of problems. As for the schools, I side with the crowd of not basing a life-long decision with the vagaries of this or that ranking list.  These are comparable schools academically.  Middlebury is the flavor of the month with the finance crowd these days.  But who cares?   When paisley ties come back into fashion, they\u2019ll be enthusiastically wearing them and touting some other school.  That\u2019s a fickle crowd. I\u2019d be proud to have my D attend any of the three, so if she fits well at all, and if playing the sport really matters then Haverford is your answer. It\u2019s a an unusual situation you find yourself in based in my experience.  ```\n"
