This is not directly related to your ability to afford college, maybe, but it could be, and it certainly could improve your ability to have fun in college and provide for your future: Let\u2019s say you took a 15-hr (per week) job making $10/hour. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re at Nebraska and the state/local taxes are low-to-nil, so you\u2019re keeping about $130 of that per week. That comes to about $550 per month (since months average more than four full weeks). If you adopted a \u201cspend half, save half\u201d mentality, you could:  Spend an average of $65 per week. That could buy you five pizzas, or two pizzas and two movies, or two cheap dates, or one fancy date \u2013 every week. You could buy a soda now and then, chips, candy bar, whatever. Aside from adding some \u201cfun/food money\u201d to your college experience, it would also teach you how to plan and execute a budget, which is a valuable thing to learn. A lot of people don\u2019t know how to do that, go into credit card and other types of debt, and it causes major problems. Save an average of $65 per week. If you are on campus for 34 weeks out of the year, that\u2019s right around $2200 in savings. Or maybe you spend a little less or make a little more money, so you\u2019re saving $2500 per year. At graduation, you\u2019d have $10,000.  That $10,000 is $10,000 worth of access to opportunity and added security. It can help you put down a down payment on a house, it can come in handy if you are out of work for months, you can take a piece of it and do some traveling, etc.  ```\n"
