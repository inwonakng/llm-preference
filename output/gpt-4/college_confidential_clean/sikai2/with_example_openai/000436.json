Also, it is important to distinguish between business honors & university wide honors programs. Please remember that many posters have sons & daughters & nieces & nephews at UGA & may have different, yet well founded, experiences & knowledge to share. OP: It is fairly easy for you to check out recruiting at IU-Kelley versus UGA-Terry. An important factor relates to size of each schools\u2019 respective MBA program. UGA-Terry has about 103 full time MBA students while IU-Kelley has about 392 full time MBA students. . IU\u2019s MBA program has higher admission standards than does UGA-Terry. It is easy to verify which school attracts more recruiters. Also, recruiting/placement opportunities are different for the approximate 20 Foundation Fellows at UGA then it is for other students so Deloitte & MBB & New York City recruiters are not banging down the doors at UGA. Nevertheless, the cost difference of $25,000 per year is substantial\u2013even though it may be affordable for your family.  ```\n"
