I took that to mean full time enrollment like my son was able to do.  I think this was a change in policy that was just announced for this class.  I am not sure though of their position on part time classes.  I would direct you to call the admissions office if you are really interested in an answer for that.  Good luck to your daughter at GT.  ```\n"
