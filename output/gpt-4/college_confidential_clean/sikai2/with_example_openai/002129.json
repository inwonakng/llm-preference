I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be successful regardless of the school he attends.  @intparent There\u2019s more to life than work, money and the ranking and prestige of your alma mater and success isn\u2019t measured by the size of your paycheck or who your work for.  Quality of life matters and a college needs to be a good fit in addition to offering a high quality education. There\u2019s also a study by a Princeton economist found that the earnings of students from Ivies and students who were accepte at elite schools but chose to attend elsewhere were essentially the same. \"\"In 1999, economists from Princeton and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation looked at some of the same data Professor Eide and his colleagues had used, but crunched them in a different way: they compared students at more selective colleges to others of \u201cseemingly comparable ability,\u201d based on their SAT scores and class rank, who had attended less selective schools, either by choice or because a top college rejected them. The earnings of graduates in the two groups were about the same \u2014 perhaps shifting the ledger in favor of the less expensive, less prestigious route. (The one exception was that children from \u201cdisadvantaged family backgrounds\u201d appeared to earn more over time if they attended more selective colleges. The authors, Stacy Berg Dale and Alan B. Krueger, do not speculate why, but conclude, \u201cThese students appear to benefit most from attending a more elite college.\u201d)\"\" Congrats @pbmcdoug on making your decision.  Now you can enjoy the remainder of your senior year!  ```\n"
