Do they have $60K set aside for your college or would that be a struggle for them? Do they have other children to educate or is it just you? And how do you see yourself in 10 years? You are obviously very bright. Do you want to be a big-city lawyer? If so, Fordham gives you a foothold in NYC. Or do you want a more laidback life with lots of fun? Alabama probably only gives you entrance into \u2026 Alabama, but that might be just fine with you. Very different schools! Good luck!  ```\n"
