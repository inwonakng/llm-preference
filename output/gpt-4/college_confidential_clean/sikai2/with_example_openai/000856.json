I don\u2019t have anything to say about either Duke or Brown.  They both seem like very good schools.  All I can say is that studies show that your son\u2019s choice of college probably won\u2019t affect his career earnings.  However, that doesn\u2019t say anything about his experience for the next 4 years. My only advice, which addresses the academic experience and not the social experience, would be for your son to read the course catalogs of the two universities and try to make up a 4-year schedule for each.  Are there courses or programs that seem more appealing at one versus the other?  Brown offers an Open Curriculum, which gives students a lot of choice, but is that something that your son would take advantage of?  On the other hand, Duke has more traditional General Education requirements, and maybe those classes seem more in line with your son\u2019s preferences.  Perhaps your son\u2019s anticipated major has more advanced electives at one university compared with the other, or a more well thought-out introductory series. Best of luck with his decision!  ```\n"
