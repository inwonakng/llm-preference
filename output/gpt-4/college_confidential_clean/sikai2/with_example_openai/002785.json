I\u2019ve heard that it relates, at least in part, to historical factors \u2013 specifically Bates\u2019 attitude towards coeducation. [/quote]  To reinforce the point about \u201calumni involvement\u201d, check out the alumni giving rate in the latest USN&WR ranking. Bates has a 42% alumni giving rate, which is an impressive number \u2013 slightly higher than Hamilton (40%) or Colby (41%). USN&WR currently rates Bates at #14 among National LACs for alumni giving rate. Furthermore, Bates has a higher alumni giving rate than any university ranked by USN&WR, except for two (Princeton and Dartmouth).  ```\n"
