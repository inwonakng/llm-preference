She really needs current students from both colleges to weigh in on the specifics she asked about.\u201d @CottonTales, I wasn\u2019t the one who brought up this issue. Another poster, without any direct connection to Dartmouth, did. But if @gigichuck has concerns about the environment for persons of color at Dartmouth, perhaps they\u2019d be the best ones to reach out to her to share their experiences (as your kid did about Amherst.) And of course hearing from other current students about the specific issues in her original post would be helpful.  ```\n"
