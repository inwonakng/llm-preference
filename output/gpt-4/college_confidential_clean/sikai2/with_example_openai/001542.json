I do know you can \u2013 and will \u2013 get a great education at UW-Madison. We have a son who opted for Madison, loves it and just three days ago was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa there as a junior. He studies hard, has ECs, and I\u2019m sure you will, too, and that you would not lose your scholarship. It\u2019s good to learn that Madison now offers scholarships to out-of-state and Minn. reciprocity students, unlike three years ago. The monetary resources that you would save by enrolling at Madison would be available for medical school. It would be a treat to enter residency without $300,000+ of med school debt. BTW \u2013 let us know in two weeks what choice you make. You\u2019ll likely change your mind twice a day until you feel good about a decision.  ```\n"
