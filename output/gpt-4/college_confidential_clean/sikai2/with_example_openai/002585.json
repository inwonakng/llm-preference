Check out: www.thecollegesolution.com/the-colleges-where-phds-get-their-start/ According to those lists, Carleton is #7 for sending students on to PhD programs in Physics.  Amherst appears on other lists, but not the physics list.  That\u2019s one data point, if you are looking at numeric data, but you also got a great anecdote from a poster here who majored in physics at Amherst, so individual experiences may vary. As long as both physics programs look like they can match his needs and interests, he might weigh environmental factors of the school more heavily. Carleton has St. Olaf nearby, but Amherst shares a consortium with Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Hampshire, and U Mass Amherst. That increases the breadth of courses available to you. And that also means there are a lot of women around! The open curriculum does not mean just that you can avoid subjects. It means that everyone in every class is there because they are truly interested in the subject. That has to influence class discussions. Amherst has seemingly limitless resources. Our tour guide said he was blown away by how much they can do for their students. He told us about how you can borrow a car and go to Boston or the White Mountains in NH or something, and Amherst even will reimburse the students for the gas. As far as the athletic thing goes: as you pointed out, people say that about Williams too. I never played a sport at Williams. I never even went to a game a game at Williams. I am the least athletic person ever. And I was very happy socially and never felt excluded from anything in any way. You find like-minded friends wherever you go, I think. And Williams at least had a very friendly culture where people interacted across groups, maybe because of the freshman entry system mixing up everyone from the start. Our tour guide at Amherst this year wasn\u2019t an athlete, either, and he was African American, and a math/philosophy double major, and he was very happy at Amherst. I know Amherst better than Carleton, as someone who visited Amherst three times before picking Williams, my husband applied there too, and we have visited it recently with my son. None of us had any interest in leaving the northeast, so we did not visit Carleton, but it does sound awesome in college guides and on this site. Good luck! Either choice will be a fantastic opportunity!  ```\n"
