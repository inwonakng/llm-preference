You can always point out areas of concentration that are strengths, after all, the University of Colorado is ranked #1 in the WORLD in molecular physics (because the professor that teaches it is a Nobel laureate in the field).  That doesn\u2019t make CU the #1 Uni in the world.  The undergraduate experience will be quite different for an undergrad at Columbia then at UMich.  The cohort at Columbia will ALL be top notch.  Columbia has a breadth of quality across many disciplines, not just a few.  Seriously if you wanted to do just CS, do a boot camp and you\u2019ll probably learn more about programming that is useful to the field than 4 years at Columbia or UMich, or course, what you\u2019ll lack is an education, and Columbia will get you a better overall education by a good margin.  We won\u2019t go into class sizes, state legislature dictating tuition etc., and lack of funding for publics, so IMO they are not peers.  The top privates are simply in a different class.  ```\n"
