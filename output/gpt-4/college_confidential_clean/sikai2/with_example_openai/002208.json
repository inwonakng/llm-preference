I thought your post made it seem that only Stanford does that (give credit for their sport).  I won\u2019t comment on the passing around a list of easy classes because I\u2019m not aware of that at my kid\u2019s school. Post#56\u2026\u201cStanford has each varsity sport as an actual class the team members take for credit in which they just do their sport. They were also dinged by the NCAA for passing around a list of easy classes for athletes to take. You aren\u2019t going to find that at Princeton.\u201d  ```\n"
