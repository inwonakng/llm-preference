She is CS/premed. We were willing to pay, but she decided to go where she can have a higher undergraduate GPA, better ROI, and where she can be happiest, etc. She never looked back. For CS, I don\u2019t think it matters where you graduate when you are interviewing, as long as you demonstrate the competency, skills, etc. Michigan is way better college for CS than Vandy!! Sorry about my humble brag   ```\n"
