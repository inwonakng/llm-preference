My understanding is they do allow it, and even if they didn\u2019t they couldn\u2019t police it anyway. And here\u2019s a link to a gap year blog on the Olin site that talks specifically about taking classes: http://www.olin.edu/blog/olin-admission/post/gap-year-part-2-time-flying/ And I share in being sorry for the thread hijack, but I couldn\u2019t leave the bad info up there.  ```\n"
