Temple: 34% have a GPA over 3.75, average GPA is 3.56. Average ACT is 27, average SAT is 1180, with 25% above 1250/30, about 10% above 700 on either part of the SAT. 24% in top 10% of class. 38% small classes, 18% large to very large classes. Nebraska: 39% have a GPA over 3.75, average GPA is 3.65, average ACT is 25, average SAT is 1150, with 25% 1280/29, about 13-14% above 700 on either part of the SAT. 24% in top 10% of class. 38% small classes, 24% large to very large classes.
