And over every 40 year period in that timeframe, the average annual compounded returns for a 40 year period have ranged from 8.9% to 12.5%. I picked 5% to be extremely conservative. And sure, you\u2019d have to pay taxes. You have to pay taxes on anything. That still doesn\u2019t change the fact that if you take $200K and let it compound instead of spending it, you\u2019re going to end up with a ton of money. Millions. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d rather have millions and pay taxes on that than not have millions. And certainly, if the OP has so much wealth that they just have another $200K (or multiple $200K\u2019s) lying around that they could let compound, then why not splurge? Like I said, if you have 8 figures in liquid assets, feel free to do whatever you like with that money.  ```\n"
