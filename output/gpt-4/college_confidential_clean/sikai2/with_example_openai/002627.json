Even amongst the top 5 schools, the actual numbers are pretty tiny (say 50-100 students actively deciding between a couple top 5s). Below the top 5 schools, then, the number of cross-admits going to any other school is really small - like in the single and low double digits. It is amazing - as HYMPS have similar admissions \u201csystems,\u201d out of, say, the 1-2 million people applying to US colleges in any given year, only about 8,000-9,000 are truly in the running at the top 5.  That\u2019s maybe only an eighth of a percent of the applicant pool!  This speaks to: 1.) the selectivity at the tippy top AND 2.) a narrow-mindedness in what the top schools seek.  Dean Shaw, in the Stanford Report, noted that he needs to come up with reasons why a student is accepted at Stanford and not Harvard, and faculty question him on it.  I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good thing that all top schools now define \u201cexcellence\u201d in the same narrow way.  ```\n"
