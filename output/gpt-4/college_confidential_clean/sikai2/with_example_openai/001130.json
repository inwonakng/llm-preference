Did you get into Carroll school?  If so and you want to work on east coast in govt or banking my opinion would be BC. If not it\u2019s a toss up. My daughter got into BC and USC but chose USC for the weather . She also had honors college at UF and full scholarship. UF isn\u2019t UNC but it\u2019s a top 10 USNWR public uni like unc.  It\u2019s pretty close. She is premed though not business. If she got into Carroll and not the other schools b schools it would be 100 percent BC  ```\n"
