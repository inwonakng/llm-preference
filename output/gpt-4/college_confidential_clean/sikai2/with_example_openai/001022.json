At many no-name high schools all over the country, the seniors most likely to get into Harvard and Stanford are the recruited athletes.  Are they smart?  Sure.  Are they intellectual?  Maybe or maybe not, but that has nothing to do with why they would get in and many smarter and more intellectual students would not.   Often the middle class intellectual students are those who decide to take a merit scholarship.   They are overlooked by the Ivies because being an intellectual does not necessarily translate into an outstanding college application. Some, like LoveTheBard\u2019s daughter, are so brilliant they easily stand out and are admitted to those schools.  Most don\u2019t stand out nearly as much as the wealthy student from the connected private schools who regularly send a significant number of students to those schools. \u201cBrilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools.\u201d It\u2019s a bit like the blind men touching one part of the elephant and being certain of its shape based on the part they touched. A family member went to Stanford and it is not \u201cintellectual\u201d.  It has many students who ARE intellectual and it has  students who are not and are very career focused.  As does Harvard.  As does U. Chicago.  As do Wash U., Duke and USC.  A student can choose to seek them out or not. Making a difference doesn\u2019t always mean starting a foundation with your family\u2019s money or the connections they have to help you start it. It doesn\u2019t mean developing an app that someone will pay you millions to buy. Making a difference may be those \u201cdull\u201d serious students working hard for As to get into medical school and be the doctors who save lives.  Making a difference may be those \u201cdull\u201d scientists sitting in their labs examining some tiny aspect of mitochondria that will eventually lead to a cure for some disease. Making a difference is not always an earnest \u201cintellectual\u201d student who loves to talk about ideas and even write about them.  ```\n"
