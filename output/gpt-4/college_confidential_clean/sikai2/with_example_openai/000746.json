For example: \"\" And, scholarships will be higher for people with more impressive resumes (i.e. Wharton).\"\" This is as incorrect as a statement can be. Scholarships typically specify the qualifications. Most are for female & minority applicants to MBA schools. As far as resume considerations, it is primarily what one has done in the post undergraduate years. = one\u2019s work experience\u2013although grades (GPA) & school are considered. \u201cAlso, don\u2019t listen to people who are comparing Wharton UG vs. Stern UG & MBA.\u201d  Wharton finance & Stern finance majors compete for the same jobs. Pointing out that OP would save enough for an MBA if Stern UG is chosen reveals value & flexibility. Not all Wharton finance get their job of choice; and, if they do, not all remain as they may not fit, get fired or leave on their own. \u201cMBA salaries are equal for the same job no matter what school you go to\u2026\u201d Yes, but the salary differentiation is supplied by the schools to US News & pay reveals much about the type & location of the positions into which MBA grads of a particular school get. This sentence also is a reason NOT to go to Wharton for $184,000 plus interest extra since Stern finance & Wharton finance grads compete for the same jobs at the same pay level.  ```\n"
