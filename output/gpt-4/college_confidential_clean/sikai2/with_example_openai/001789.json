[/quote]  I\u2019m a little confused here about why the cost of college has to pay off immediately. Presumably the parents put $250K in a 529 for the purposes of their kid spending it on education. If the OP wants to go to grad school in CS, that would be a fully funded program. No one pays for a CS grad degree at a good university. (Maybe they live cheaply, but that\u2019s OK for 20-somethings.) Is there some indication in this thread that the parents are hurting for money? The part about the parent\u2019s retirement money seems to be the OP\u2019s misunderstanding that grad school in CS would be something his parents would pay for. If the money is in a 529 for education, why not spend it on MIT? I say go to CPW and figure out whether MIT is the right school for you. If it is and your parents aren\u2019t hurting for money, go there.  ```\n"
