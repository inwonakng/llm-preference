Stacy Dale and Alan Krueger performed a careful analysis of this question in 2002, and concluded that \u201cStudents who attended more selective colleges do not earn more than other students who were accepted and rejected by comparable schools but attended less selective colleges. \u2026 These results are consistent with the conclusion of Hunt\u2019s seminal research: \u2018The C student from Princeton earns more than the A student from Podunk not mainly because he has the prestige of a Princeton degree, but merely because he is abler.  The golden touch is possessed not by the Ivy League College, but by its students.\u2019\u201d In other words, for career success as measured by salary, then for a given student, it turns out not to matter what college the student attends.  It is the student\u2019s own abilities and personal traits that, in general, will determine his or her success.  ```\n"
