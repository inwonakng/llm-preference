Northwestern is a mid west school. I went to Penn. I applied to Washington university. Knew of u of Chicago and Notre Dom but even when my kids applied didn\u2019t really know anything about northwestern. Being from New Jersey I knew North Eastern, always got them confused. Rice I was always vaguely aware of because of its connection to NASA and to Kennedy and to science in general. I know that\u2019s just me but I am not that unique. I just went through two rounds of college for my kids neither had northwestern anywhere on their radar and I don\u2019t think anyone from their high school applied and HS sent multiple kids to the ivies every year. A good friend of my daughter got a full ride at NorthEastern and other kids applied there.Anyway I think Northwestern is even more known mainly in its region then Rice.  ```\n"
