Regular decision 6.3% acceptance rate.  Clearly defined peer group of U Chicago, Brown, Columbia and Penn. based on statistics of matriculating class Michigan doesn\u2019t appear in the top 20 Or match Up as a peer.  Wash U or Emory as Peers.  Great school but not Duke. The Duke name cari\u00ebs more cache in the finance space buy a Wide margin.  I base  this on thirty years of experience.  Duke kids are nethodically recruited by NY IB shops and benefit from the depth and breath of there alumni network. Michigan has not been a target of any of the three major banks i have worked For.  Occasionaly a resum\u00e9 would Pass my desk but limited if any true support. Rather than spliting hairs as you say Lets be honest and direct.  Duke has a far superior reputation in Finance then Michigan. Michigan is largely perceived as a safe school For talenten and smart kids givin its both large and public with managable addmissions rates.  Duke is viewed as far more selectieve with a 6.3% RD acceptanten rate.  1,900 valadictorions applied To Duke and 29% were accepted.  Stated differently i am sure there is a ven diagram that would show overlap between the two schools studen bodies but those out Side of the shared space at Duke would be far superior accademically then those out of the shared space from Michigan. Saying things like i could have taken the ACT and grotten a Higher score or anecdotely pointing out studentes who got  rejected at Mich (potential yield Protection) but into Duke or the suggestion that michigan Somehow looks harder at applications all simply wrong ang pure speculation in the hope of Boeing persuasive. Every number produced suggesties Duke has a prestige advantage. US. News ranks Duke # 11 in counselors rank Vs Mich at #22 and over all Duk #9 Vs Michigan #28 Duke has a better reputation, is harder to get into and is more heavily recruited from.  Saying otherwise is purely an attempt to minimize a well defined hierarchical difference.  ```\n"
