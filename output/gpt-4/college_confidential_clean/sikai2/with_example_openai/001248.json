Another good metric of a university\u2019s quality is how well its graduates do at the executive level. Duke can lay claim to Tim Cook (Apple\u2019s CEO), Eddie Cue (Apple\u2019s Sr VP of Internet Software and Services), Jeff Williams (Apple\u2019s COO), Amy Hood (Microsoft\u2019s CFO), Scott Guthrie (Head of Microsoft\u2019s AI and Cloud Computing divisions), Terry Myerson (EVP and former head of Windows at Microsoft), etc. ^ I\u2019m sure that Brown and Cal have alums in high places but that list is pretty hard to beat. 3 of Apple\u2019s 11 top executives have Duke degrees as do 3 of Microsoft\u2019s top 16.  ```\n"
