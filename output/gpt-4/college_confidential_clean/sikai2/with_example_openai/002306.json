For probably 95% + of the population, this is  probably a no brainer.  This is not Michigan instate  vs. need based  aid at Columbia that brings the cost down to at or near instate costs. These are both great schools .  The major tech firms recruit at both .  With a CS degree , you may not even need a graduate degree. But, if you decide that you want or need one, you might be glad to have the funds available to pay for it. If your parents are made of money though , there are no siblings to consider,  it\u2019s a non issue. Go where you prefer. Good luck with the decision.  ```\n"
