Besides, who knows what your son will become interested in once he starts college? In this comparison, I think the academics are generally comparable. However, your son may prefer the open curriculum of Amherst to the breadth requirements of Carleton (or vice versa). I would caution you on comparing specific professors. You\u2019ll find great professors at both schools. Then there is the question of three classes per trimester (Carleton) vs. four classes per semester (Amherst). This can make a huge difference, depending on your son\u2019s learning style. As an example, since my firstborn is a champion of procrastination and last-minute cramming, like her father, the trimester system is excellent. She is used to the fast pace given her background in taking classes at the community college (quarter system), and the ten-week schedule will give her no time to slack off. On the other hand, a friend of ours with a chemistry degree from Berkeley looked at the syllabus of the intro chemistry class and said, \u201cWhoa. That\u2019s a lot to absorb in such a short period of time.\u201d The semester system gives you more time to let concepts sink in. What does your son prefer? Is he disciplined about staying on top of his work and pacing himself? Regarding @juillet 's point about facilities, I can tell you firsthand that Carleton\u2019s science facilities are better than Amherst\u2019s, and further improvements are in the works. Then again, someone mentioned that Amherst also has improvement projects planned, so during your son\u2019s time in college, this may become a wash.  ```\n"
