The latest class was 65% white 15% Asian 6% Latino 5% African American.     I think that is typical of midwestern universities by the way.  Case Western is similar. Most US midwestern college campuses have a lower percentage of  African American students  compared to the populations in their respective states, such as Ohio or Michigan. Notice Michigan is 14% African American residents, 4% Asian and 78% white. https://suburbanstats.org/population/how-many-people-live-in-michigan Cornell has a lot more financial aid  money offer students I believe, so they can attract a wider range of students, although Michigan ought to be able to offer more seats to African Americans from Michigan, I would question that but it may come down to scholarship availability, I do not know.
