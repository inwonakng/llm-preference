It doesn\u2019t matter what our backgrounds are. The opinions are the same. @jzducol You hit some great points. No one knows what you paid or if you won a scholarship or not. The top of the top cannot ever be compared to the top 20 or top 10. Perception and reputation open more doors than many people may every realize unless they attend one of the top programs. Not to mention going after research funds. The best college names open doors for 40 years (working lifetime). That is more than 250K for most people.  ```\n"
