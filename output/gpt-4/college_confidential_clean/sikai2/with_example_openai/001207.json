Your parents are making the best decision for you in their minds. It\u2019s becsuse they love you and want all the best for you in life. If they can find an advantage for you the they want you to have it. The problem is that wash u in some circles, especially anyone with New England or NE roots doesn\u2019t know the school very well. Or USNWR moving bowdoin up the most recently has made a surge in interest. It\u2019s more about a top LAC versus a top small university. Wash u is just as good. But a bit different. There are other rankings out there. Find some that project how great wash u is and show them. Also they are top 20 in the most crowded category with heavy weights hypsdg and the ucs etc How would bowdoin rank if rated against that group. Very high but not number 3.  ```\n"
