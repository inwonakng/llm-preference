There is no such thing as a \u201clesser Ivy\u201d. It is a contradiction in terms. All Ivies are excellent. But I object to the insinuation that Cornell is better than Michigan. Cornell was co-founded by a Michigan professor, and 7 of its 14 presidents were either Michigan alumni or Michigan faculty, including the incoming president, Martha Pollack, who is awesome by the way! The two universities are virtually identical when it comes to academic prowess, reputation, student quality, resources, etc\u2026 With regards to college towns, I do not deny Ithaca\u2019s charm. It is quaint, charming, safe, intellectual etc\u2026At no time did I mock\u2026or knock it. Ann Arbor is just a more complete college town. Small enough to be intimate, quaint and charming, but large enough to accommodate most types. The Detroit suburbs have much to offer as well, and having a large international airport 20 miles away makes life easier, especially for international students. I agree that for outdoorsy types, Ithaca is hard to beat though, but it is tiny, not easily accessible on foot, isolated, and very easily outgrown.  ```\n"
