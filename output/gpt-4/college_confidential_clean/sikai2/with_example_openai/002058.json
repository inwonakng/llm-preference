She\u2019s also mentioned lots of stories of bargain shopping, kids with campus jobs, \u201cfree\u201d stuff, and the normal spending habits of students on a budget.  If they go out on the weekends, etc. she is not spending a lot of money and there are plenty of opportunities on campus for entertainment that require no money.  ```\n"
