If you look at her post history, her child enrolled at Rice \u2013 so some obvious bias there. And confusing NE with NU is analogous to confusing Penn State with Penn, which doesn\u2019t happen among educated people. Look at the top NYC private prep schools / New England private prep schools / CA private prep schools like Harvard Westlake where these students largely can choose wherever they want to go and Northwestern will be in the top 10-15 most represented schools. Rice will not be found. Also, look at the top 10-15 feeder schools to the top MBA programs, and you\u2019ll see Northwestern there. Look at Columbia, HBS, Wharton, Stanford, etc. Rice - no where to be found. Also, look at the incoming Investment Banking analyst classes in NY at the top banks - Northwestern will have a few analysts. Rice may have some students at the Houston offices but usually not in NY. Rice is a great school. But, it\u2019s reputation just isn\u2019t that strong on the coats. And considering that Northwestern is more selective / has higher test scores than Rice and AND has more students from NY and NJ in its freshman class than Rice\u2019s entire freshman class (including Texas), I would beg to differ that Rice has a stronger reputation. Not even close. Look at Dalton (one of very top private prep schools in NYC) - https://www.dalton.org/page/programs/high-school/college-counseling Look at Harvard MBA top MBA feeder colleges - https://poetsandquants.com/2011/08/15/top-feeder-colleges-to-harvard-business-school/  ```\n"
