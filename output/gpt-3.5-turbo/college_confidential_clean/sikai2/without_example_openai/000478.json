This is true for all of us except the OP. If costs were equal or close, then it would be foolish to turn down the opportunities, benefits & stature of attending IU-Kelley & the Hutton Honors College. But OP is young & needs to determine whether he wants to relax & enjoy during his first year or is ready to study & build career connections. Both paths are fine. Just no need to spend the extra funds if not ready to take advantage of being a direct admit & Hutton Honors & working toward Business Honors. Worth repeating: Recruiting & job placement & internships are much more competitive & involve more preparation & planning than was necessary 27 years ago.  ```\n"
