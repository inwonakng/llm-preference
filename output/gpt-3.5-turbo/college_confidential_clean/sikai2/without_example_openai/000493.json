There were two deaths, I believe. Passed out drunk & froze to death in a nearby cornfield. I think that while almost all colleges have a large segment of students who drink, some schools have a binge drinking culture often attributed to rural location, small size & isolation. I think that the Kenyon administration has addressed the issue in a forceful manner over the past few years. Kenyon College is actively addressing the heavy drinking culture so things may have gotten better over the past few years. Actually some poster or posters complained a year or two ago, that the crackdown by the administration was too harsh.  ```\n"
