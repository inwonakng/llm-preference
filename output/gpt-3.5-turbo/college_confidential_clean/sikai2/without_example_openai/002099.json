As parents posting on this site, we typically take the perspective of wanting the best for our kids. Objectively, that would lean heavily towards UM. That said, there is nothing objective about the college admissions process. So much of it comes down to not best, but rather, best for you. Only you can determine that. We look at rankings, history, reputation, etc. and it seems like a slam dunk. We, however, haven\u2019t walked in your shoes. You need to decide what feels better. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll consider all relevant data and make a great choice. Good luck and all the best!  ```\n"
