[/quote]  That would be my kid who stated exactly that reason for preferring an open curriculum.  But lo and behold, she\u2019s taken a writing class and a couple of humanities courses and in one case encountered a favorite professor. She is a STEM major in a small department and so far that means she gets a lot of attention from the dept chair and her professors, help with planning summer research, study abroad plus research connections, and rec letters. I don\u2019t have much to add to the very helpful posts here so far, but will point to a couple of resources you may find helpful. The science center is under construction and is supposed to open fall '18. There are details here: https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/future/greenway-campus/science-center Amherst hosts a SURF program in the following areas (currently, they change year to year): https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/support/funding/students/amherst-student-research-funding-opportunities/summer-research-opportunities-at-amherst/2017-surf-research-areas - it\u2019s paid and comes with housing. They will also provide funding for unpaid internships and research elsewhere. My D also wanted to get out of the midwest, and we also have family in the NE, SO I get where your S is coming from. Carleton sounds like an amazing place too, I can\u2019t see you going wrong here.  ```\n"
