My son is in a bunch of them and barely checks them at all.  And my advice is to not check/post at all. There isn\u2019t a big drug culture at all on campus.  St. Louis is definitely not Berkeley-we never noticed anything of the sort during our visits. As for Greek life, it\u2019s not that pervasive.  You are under no pressure to join. WashU is a collaborative environment.  My son isn\u2019t a PoliSci major (actually Biology/History) and is in multiple study groups.  ```\n"
