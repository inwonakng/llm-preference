The administration took action to curb dangerous drinking at Dartmouth\u2013and I think the experiment is still too young to know how successful it\u2019s been. My understanding is that the reaction has been very mixed on campus. But you\u2019re seriously deriding an effort to do something about the issue of excessive underage drinking, something that exists on just about every campus in America? As for the Review, it offers a hard-right perspective that\u2019s always represented a fraction of the student body and is held in contempt by the majority. That\u2019s been the case since it first formed in the early 80s, and certainly Dartmouth\u2019s student population has become decidedly more liberal since then. The D takes much more traditionally liberal positions. I happen to think publications with alternative viewpoints\u2013across the political spectrum\u2013are a good thing, but I object to the times that the Review has crossed the line over the years. Once again, unless current students of color want to weigh in on the merits of Dartmouth vs Amherst, there\u2019s little point of continuing this back and forth. And frankly, it\u2019s not particularly germane to what the OP asked. Are there any current CS students or recent grads who can add to the discussion?  ```\n"
