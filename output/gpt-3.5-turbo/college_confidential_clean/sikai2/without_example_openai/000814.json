Difficulty of admissions is subjective in this case. Pomona has a slightly lower acceptance rate (8.4% versus 11.7% for Hopkins) but Hopkins has the edge in freshman test scores: SAT scores of enrolled freshman for Pomona for class of 2021: 1330 - 1520 ACT scores of enrolled freshman for Pomona for class of 2021: 30 - 34 Percent of freshman in top 10% of class: 94% SAT scores of enrolled freshman for Johns Hopkins for class of 2021: 1460 - 1580 ACT scores of enrolled freshman for Johns Hopkins for class of 2021: 33 - 35 Percent of freshman in top 10% of class: 93%  ```\n"
