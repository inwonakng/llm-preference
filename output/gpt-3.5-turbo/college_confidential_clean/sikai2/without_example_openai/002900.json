I too have friends that did pre-med (and are still there) at Hopkins as did my roommate, so I\u2019d think being closer to the vest is more reputed than your third hand assertions. Cornell selectivity is also not quite apples to apples since they have a CALS division. What\u2019s also clear is that Hopkins is enrolling more academically accomplished students (similar to what Northwestern began doing in the past) - while still maintaining yield, which makes the lower yield more impressive than Cornell or Dartmouth.  Hopkins also isn\u2019t just taking high scorers with potential lower rank ala vandy (with 87% ranked in top 10%) SATs of enrolled freshman: Hopkins: SAT (M+V old scale):1420 to 1570 Freshman in top 10%: 94% Cornell: SAT (M+V old scale):1330 to 1520 Freshman in top 10%: 90%  ```\n"
