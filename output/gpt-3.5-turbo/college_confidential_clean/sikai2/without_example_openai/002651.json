Olin grads get hired easily, but so do GT grads, even in Boston.  And again, you need to go back to the OP.  His desire for \u201cexploring research projects related to robotics and autonomous systems\u201d points to the world class research institution, even for the undergrad learning experience.  Olin is great, for the right person, but to me this OP is better fit at GT.  ```\n"
