It just said \u201cGeorgetown Scholarship\u201d for part of the award. If you have not already contacted your individual financial aid POC, I would do so now to make sure that your package is in process. The financial aid POC was great, and told us when a decision has been made and when to expect it.  There are listings by last name on the web site. My son is currently weighing Georgetown SFS and UVA.  Will be headed to GAAP on 4/20.  Decisions, decisions. Good luck.  ```\n"
