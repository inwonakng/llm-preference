[/quote]  You can take many ~1 credit PE-type athletic classes at Stanford and I expect the other discussed colleges.  For example, I took weight training and karate for 1 quarter.   Both were 1 credit P/F type classes that required ~2 hours of practice per week.   I don\u2019t see why spending 20+ hours per week of athletic practice in a sport shouldn\u2019t give you at least as much credit as a PE class.  However,  rowing is only a ~1 credit class like PE classes, and most rowers were not eligible at the time I was on the team.  The ~1 credit is little in comparison to the 180 credits required to graduate, and does not at all reflect the many hours of practice and commitment that is required to be on the team.  In my opinion, it\u2019s far more challenging to be a successful student as an athlete than non-athlete.  ```\n"
