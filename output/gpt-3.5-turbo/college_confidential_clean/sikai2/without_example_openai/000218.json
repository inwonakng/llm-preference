I can only speak about PSU, but supposedly only 1 in 3 who start in engineeeing actually graduate with an engineering degree. It\u2019s pretty brutal but that\u2019s also why a lot of recruiters hire students from there. You could also compare the entrance to major requirements between schools. At PSU no one is technically accepted into their major. Rather they have to take a handful of required courses and hit a certain GPA before officially declaring it.  ```\n"
