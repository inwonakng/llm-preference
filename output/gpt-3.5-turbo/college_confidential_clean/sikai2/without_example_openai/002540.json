You cannot get two mot similar universities. Both are Catholic, both have 9,000 undergraduate students and 4,000 graduate students, both have a proud football tradition, both have loyal alumni  and both have equally cold winters. Boston College is close to a mid sized city while Notre Dame is not, and that\u2019s where the differences end. UNC would be a different experience. Secular school in warmer weather. I agree with those who recommend you wait it out and graduate from Notre Dame.  ```\n"
