Yet Mizzou is one of the top 3 journalism schools in the country. Cincy has one of the top design schools (and musical theatre programs) in the country. OU has one of the top meteorology programs in the country. UIC Nursing is highly respected. In each of those fields, those schools are considered powerhouses. For instance, design people could care less about Cincy\u2019s USNews ranking. They care more about the fact that Cincy design grads are top-notch. BTW, the USNews rankings can be gamed. I would not rely on them. I personally prefer my tiers based off of alumni achievements: https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/1893105-ivy-equivalents-ranking-based-on-alumni-outcomes-take-2-1-p1.html Those can not be gamed.  ```\n"
