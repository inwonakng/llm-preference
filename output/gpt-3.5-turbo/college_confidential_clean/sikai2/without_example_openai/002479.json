Hyde Park doesn\u2019t really compare, now if you want to talk Evanston ok. Here\u2019s what you should do - go to Chicago and Stanford in February, during mid winter break.  I visited Chicago then and the tour guide kept saying, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll go inside in a minute, we\u2019ll go inside I promise.  Needless to say Stanford\u2019s tour guides rarely say that. Anyway back to the OP, despite the weather, Chicago is a top notch school for your intended majors so if you\u2019re comfortable there, apply EA if you can, if it\u2019s ED, I\u2019d recommend you not apply ED as that will really cut down on your flexibility.  Apply SCEA Stanford as your original plan and RD Chicago and see what happens. The only drawback to Chicago wrt Stanford is that students change majors a lot, and if you decide that you\u2019d like to pursue computer science, then you\u2019re better off at Stanford.  Like really better off.  ```\n"
