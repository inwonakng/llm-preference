Not every Penn\u2013Wharton grad gets, or even wants, the highest paying career on Wall Street. Even if obtained, not all stay, not all survive. If the economy is great, then NYU Stern grads are going to get recruited just like Penn-Wharton grads for finance. If the economy is weak, then OP has $184,000 plus interest advantage plus a prestigious finance degree from NYU\u2013Stern. @ccfk1221: Whether or not OP wants to obtain a graduate degree is not the core issue; it is that by saving $184,000 plus interest, OP would have the option of obtaining a graduate degree. OP may want to get a law degree or put the savings to use in another fashion or just enjoy life without the pressure of large student loans. I think that everyone has something to contribute to this thread.  ```\n"
