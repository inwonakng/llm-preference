It shows a job candidate isn\u2019t interested in ultimately being an engineer, and thus is an impediment to getting a first job. No company of note will put an inexperienced engineer in a managerial position, no matter how prestigious the MBA. A blended 5 year technical BS/MS on the other hand is quite valuable. No more so than any other MS, but it gets the candidate there quicker.  ```\n"
