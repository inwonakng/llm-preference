We used to live in the Midwest and had also toured WashU. Both are wonderful schools and you are fortunate to have such great choices. Bowdoin is small, and was smaller than my S\u2019s high school, but my S loved it there and made great friends he still keeps in contact with and gets together with. The town of Brunswick isn\u2019t what I would call \u201crural\u201d but is a nice little college town. There is a train station and it\u2019s easy to get to Boston. As far as transportation, the closest airport is Portland. When my S was coming back from breaks, he usually found other Bowdoin students to share a taxi with. Since he graduated, there\u2019s a new Metro Bus that connects Portland to Brunswick. St. Louis is obviously a different kind of place - the metro area is over 2 million. You can take the light rail commuter train from the airport to the campus. The WashU campus is very nice. Both schools rank very highly for campus food. Two of my S\u2019s former roommates are in graduate school at UCLA and Harvard, so if your future plan is graduate school, I think either place would prepare you well. I think the decision comes down to: would you prefer a small town in the northeast, or a larger city in the Midwest?  ```\n"
