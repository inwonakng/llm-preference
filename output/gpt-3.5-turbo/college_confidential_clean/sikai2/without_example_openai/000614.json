It is a high quality program \u2013 130 credits,  many computer science  classes, together with computer hardware and basic EE classes.  I happen to have direct knowledge of the CS classes \u2013 they are challenging!  No direct knowledge of ECE classes, but I don\u2019t think their faculty likes being left behind (in inflicting pain \u2026).  ```\n"
