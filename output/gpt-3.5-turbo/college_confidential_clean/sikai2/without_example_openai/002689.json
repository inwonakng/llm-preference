Considering that it would cost less and the Pitt auto-admit requires an insanely high GPA (if he gets that GPA, other med school\u2019s are likely as well, so the auto-admit is of little benefit), this is a no-brainer. How many people actually know what they really want to do with their life at 18, anyway? Wouldn\u2019t it suck if he realized that he didn\u2019t actually want to be a doctor after all but he went down the Pitt path?  ```\n"
