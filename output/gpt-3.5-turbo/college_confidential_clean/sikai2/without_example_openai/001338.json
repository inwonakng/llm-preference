Moreover, Hamilton might be stronger in a field such as math (a core liberal art) when compared to even a STEM-focused school such as GIT. However, you might already sense whether you are the Georgia Tech type (either positively or negatively), and, if so, this should make your decision simpler.  ```\n"
