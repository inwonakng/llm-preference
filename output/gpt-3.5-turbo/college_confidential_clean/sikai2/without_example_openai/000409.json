As previously discussed, many scholarships (if not most) at many schools mandate that the recipient maintain a minimum GPA. Frequently, those conditions are imposed by the benefactor or funder of the scholarship. If the minimum GPA is not maintained, many will reduce or withdraw the scholarship. That is quite a common condition. The vast majority I am certain will state this or any other conditions that must be satisfied up front, and in those cases the student is made aware of his/her responsibilities up front. In my experience most schools are not in the business of \u201cbait and switch\u201d.  ```\n"
