Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```@Helodada @fatherofsam  I was at CW1 this year and the Dean of Admissions said at one of the presentations that they don\u2019t want to have gap year students enroll at another college before starting at Olin.  I took that to mean full time enrollment like my son was able to do.  I think this was a change in policy that was just announced for this class.  I am not sure though of their position on part time classes.  I would direct you to call the admissions office if you are really interested in an answer for that.  Good luck to your daughter at GT.  ```\n"
