Maybe stretching up to 400-500 if you become generous at defining what a near-Ivy is. About 7000 matriculants at HYPSM. Most would not have the opportunity of a full-ride at a Near-Ivy/Ivy-equivalent. Many would have the opportunity of partial scholarships or even full-tuition scholarships from good (above the average flagship) schools or full-rides from average flagships or lower. And if this is one of those special scholars programs at UMich, don\u2019t discount the opportunities afforded by those either.  ```\n"
