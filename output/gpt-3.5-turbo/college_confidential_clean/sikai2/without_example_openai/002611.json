Not that it is any of your business, but I was accepted by Yale and chose Penn for the reasons I mentioned above. Please point me to where my posts are short on facts? In fact I happen to think that all/most of my posts are supported by facts. Just cause you don\u2019t agree with what I am saying it does not mean it is not true. So please enlighten me. You find the other post helpful because it matches your opinion. Now who is being biased and short on facts?  ```\n"
