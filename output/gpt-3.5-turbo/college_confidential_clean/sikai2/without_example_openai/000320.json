[/quote]  For engineering?  You ought to find a different crowd to consult with.  Powerhouses in engineering are often different than powerhouses for other majors.  Doing a quick google search and just looking on the search page it appears they\u2019re ranked #13.  ASU is #38.  PSU is #24.  Individual departments have their own ranking so one should look at what they are interested in if rankings matter.  As with anything else, different schools have a more directed engineering focus. Overall though, in engineering circles, yes, VT is considered an academic powerhouse.  H has had headhunters after him pretty much his whole engineering career and even when doing projects on other continents, his VT degree was respected (since many of those folks cared about the name on his diploma as well as projects he\u2019d already done).  ```\n"
