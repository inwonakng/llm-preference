Feeder school data from M7 business schools suggests as such. High GPA and research experience at UMCP --&gt; pretty good  for PhD programs in computer engineering. I don\u2019t think law schools place that much emphasis on undergrad school, though I am not particularly knowledgeable in this area. If he wants to go for a PhD program in computer engineering, money won\u2019t be an issue \u2026 if a school wants you, it will pay for you to attend. Law and business schools are a different matter. I can see that it is a hard decision. In any case, congratulations to your son on his accomplishments and being in position!  ```\n"
