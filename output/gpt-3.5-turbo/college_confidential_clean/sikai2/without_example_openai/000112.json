They never identify what the top 25 silicon valley companies are.  Secondly, there\u2019s no way a Princeton or JHU grad would be less desirable than an ASU or NC State grad (vis a vis same grades - and not trying to be elitist here given quality of education).  Lastly, there is a huge difference between what they deem could be #1 (Google where SWEs are making 300k a year with stock) vs #25 (say a Cisco where they are making $120k)  ```\n"
