I believe the answer is maybe in very few scenarios such as for investment banking and consulting and by firms such as Goldman Sachs and McKinsey which target a few schools for recruiting. A nd maybe one can argue that Stanford\u2019s proximity to Silicon Valley\u2019s ecosystem would confer some advantage for graduates interested in tech start-ups. Yes, high tech firms recruit all over the country, but the informal ways to connect with venture capitalists, founders, etc. is undeniably richer in Silicon Valley. Also, in some rare situations where the employer is a foreign country-backed (particularly China) organization looking for employees with internationally prestigious education credentials, Harvard and Stanford would offer an advantage by virtue of their reputation internationally. These are all very rare situations. For the majority of career fields, no there would not be meaningful difference.  ```\n"
