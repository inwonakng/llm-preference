Lots of community engagement opps, including as part of academics and/or service, which I hope OP learned about. The kids I know who went there found it inclusive.  The endowment didn\u2019t affect things in any noticeable way.  Both of mine went there,  made great friends, were highly educated, and are doing well. The alum network is as strong as you make it.  ```\n"
