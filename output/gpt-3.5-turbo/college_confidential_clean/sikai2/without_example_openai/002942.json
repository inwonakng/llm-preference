Cornell 25th percentiles vs Hopkins for Verbal: 680 vs 720 Keep in mind those are enrolled stats, you\u2019d see similar or greater disparities for the admitted students ACT: 32 to 35 for Hopkins.  Cornell: 31 to 34. Maybe you weren\u2019t awake during your stats class. As for Yale and Chicago versus Stanford:  Did you also forget that Stanford admits DI athletes?  ```\n"
