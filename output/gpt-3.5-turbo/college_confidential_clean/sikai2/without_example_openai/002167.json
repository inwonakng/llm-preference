I believe the numbers show that a high percentage of cross admits (~70 to 75% last time I looked) choose Stanford over Princeton, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily the right choice for you. Stanford certainly has a lot of advantages, especially if you\u2019re interested in a career in Silicon Valley after graduation. A couple of points that may swing in favor of Princeton - one, as someone noted above, Princeton\u2019s campus has more of a classic college feel, in my opinion. And since you\u2019re an athlete, one other thing to consider is that there\u2019s likely to be more travel (plane rides rather than bus rides) and midweek competition at Stanford, as the conference schools (Pac 12 or MPSF, depending on sport) are much more spread out geographically for Stanford than in the Ivy League.  ```\n"
