Unless you are a US citizen, likely Amherst is the only school on your list that will \u201cmeet need\u201d for you.  There are only 5 schools in the US that are need blind and meet need for internationals, and Amherst is on that list. Mudd (and Swat) are not.  I know for a fact that Mudd is very specific in saying this to international students that you very likely will NOT get your full need met.  I think Swat will be the same.  You mentioned being need blind above \u2013  that means a college won\u2019t reject your application because you need FA, but it has nothing to do with whether they will offer enough aid for you to attend. Also, I get the impression you want to go to med school in the US.  There are a small number of med schools in the US that treat Canadians like US citizens in admission, but nearly all consider them international.  It is extremely hard for international students to gain admission to US med schools (and to finance that education).  I\u2019d suggest you research that further before embarking on that path.  ```\n"
