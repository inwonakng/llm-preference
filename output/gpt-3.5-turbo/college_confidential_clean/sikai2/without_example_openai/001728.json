Michigan is one of the top 6 or 7 CoE in the country. 2 of MIT\u2019s last 4 presidents (Jerome Wiesner and Charles Vest) were Michigan alumni. While MIT is indeed slightly better than Michigan, it is not $250k better. Besides, you said you prefer Michigan to MIT socially, and there is much to be said for \u201cfit\u201d. Go to Michigan for college. You can always challenge yourself there and get your PhD or graduate degree from MIT at a later date.  ```\n"
