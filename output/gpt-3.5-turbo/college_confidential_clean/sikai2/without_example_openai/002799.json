Some people are just bad at certain test formats that have nothing to do with knowledge. I have one of each in my kids. One kid has always been good at standardized tests, another not so much. The one who isn\u2019t will often know the material but just doesn\u2019t respond well to the testing conditions and format.  ```\n"
