Scholarships typically specify the qualifications. Most are for female & minority applicants to MBA schools. As far as resume considerations, it is primarily what one has done in the post undergraduate years. = one\u2019s work experience\u2013although grades (GPA) & school are considered. [/quote]  MBA scholarships are an entirely different beast. They are used to secure students that they want to add to their class. For example, GSB was just ousted recently for using scholarships to secure people coming from a private equity background, and these people most certainly do not face financial constraints nor were they underrepresented candidates.  [quote] Wharton finance & Stern finance majors compete for the same jobs. Pointing out that OP would save enough for an MBA if Stern UG is chosen reveals value & flexibility. [/quote]  Yes, I agree they compete for the same jobs, and Stern places very well on the street (although typically at different firms), however you\u2019re still facing an uphill battle coming out of any school but Wharton.  [quote] Not all Wharton finance get their job of choice; and, if they do, not all remain as they may not fit, get fired or leave on their own. [/quote]  [ This isn\u2019t a valid argument \u2014 you can say the same thing about Stern grads. Make no mistake, Stern is a great choice for IB, but if you also have the option of going to Wharton then it\u2019s a no brainer. There\u2019s a great post made about this regarding MBA schools as well, [Value of a Top 10 MBA](https://gmatclub.com/forum/value-of-a-top-10-mba-213365.html), in which the basic premise is that a degree from HBS or GBS is worth full tuition vs. a full-ride at any other school. I would apply that same logic here.  ```\n"
