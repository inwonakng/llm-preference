Both UGA & IU-Kelley are great options. As a Direct Admit To IU-Kelley & to IU Honors College, it appears to be the better & wiser choice for your intended career path. Your recent posts show that you are leaning toward the more comfortable option, but not necessarily the better opportunity. Are you afraid of leaving your comfort zone & facing the challenges of growing in a place where you will not have your current classmates & friends ? IU has 34% from out-of-state, while the percentage of non-residents at UGA is 11%. Direct Admit to a nationally respected business school is significant career wise. Being admitted to an Honors College is significant both academically & socially.  ```\n"
