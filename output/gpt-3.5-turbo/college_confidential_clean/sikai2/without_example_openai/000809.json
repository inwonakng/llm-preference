One of the posters hasn\u2019t even started at JHU yet (he\u2019s Class of 2022). One of them has no experience with Pomona or the Johns Hopkins undergrad program. The other makes a completely absurd point, IMO that because it\u2019s not Harvey Mudd, Pomona shouldn\u2019t be considered. Never mind that someone with your broad interests would definitely fit in better at Pomona than Mudd (they don\u2019t offer philosophy, linguistics, or cog sci). You\u2019re going to need to think about the information you\u2019re getting and where it comes from. Quora is a prestige  obsessed website with a international audience. This one values LACs more. All of us have our own biases. At the end of the day, it\u2019s your decision and your life. If you\u2019re going to be influenced on the whim by whatever anyone has to tell you, instead of thinking critically about what your own values are, you are going to regret the decision at some point.  ```\n"
