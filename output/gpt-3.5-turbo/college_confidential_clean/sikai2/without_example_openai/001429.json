      "content": "College A: ```Vanderbilt University```\nCollege B: ```Northwestern University```\nComment: ```Can you even pay for Vanderbilt with this scholarship and no loans other than the standard federal student loans?  Would your family need to borrow more than that?  Start there. If Vanderbilt\u2019s costs are easy to cover, how about the cost of Northwestern?  How secure is your daughter\u2019s college fund?  Is there the equivalent of four years at Northwestern sitting in a 529 or the like? Or would you need to cobble together the money every year from multiple sources and tighten your belts? Provided Vanderbilt is possible without huge strain for the family, this looks pretty much like a no brainer to me.  The savings are significant and could go a long way toward helping with the costs of med school or just with helping your daughter launch into life after colege.  They also can give your daughter financial freedom while in college to take an unpaid or poorly paid internship that she really likes instead of having to pin down the best payong summer job or part time school year job that she can find.  ```\n"
