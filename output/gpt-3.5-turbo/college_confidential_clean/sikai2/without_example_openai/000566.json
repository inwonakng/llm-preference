      "content": "College A: ```University of Rochester```\nCollege B: ```Emory University```\nComment: ```Ah the peer argument\u2026  If you look at The Chronicle of Higher Education, they have a graphic that shows who colleges/universities in America labeled as peer institutions.  Emory labeled 13 schools as peers (Brown, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Princeton, Stanford, U of Chicago, U of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt, Washington U, and Yale). Only 3 of those schools also listed Emory as a peer institution (Northwestern, Vanderbilt, and Washington U).  All 3 of those schools also list Rochester U as a peer institution (along with all having a higher ranking than Emory by US News and World Report ratings) so Rochester is held in very high esteem (even with a ranking of 33 in the same US News and World Report rankings).  I only know of one student who chose between Emory and Rochester and they chose Rochester, graduated and is currently a 2nd year in Dental School.  I love Emory (I used to live less than 2 miles from the campus for many years and my wife worked at the VA Hospital in the area under an Emory researcher) and it is a great school, but there is no need to knock another great school with great outcomes.  It is really just a matter of preference.  ```\n"
