You are unlikely to have your questions answered until you visit and see each of the schools/programs in action. We had one accepted to Cal Tech but chose elsewhere after visiting. The environment was much too small for what he was looking for, but others may prefer that. When we took the engineering tour at different schools there was a clear winner for him. You are wise to consider that he may change his engineering focus when he gets there, so it is good to be happy with the engineering program/school overall. They are very different schools and if you are able to visit, that will make a big difference and provide ease in your decision process.  ```\n"
