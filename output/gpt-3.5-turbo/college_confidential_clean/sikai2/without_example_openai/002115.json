Clearly you really want to go to USC but worry that your wish to leave Michigan will lead you to a wrong decision. What if you went to USC and decided you made a mistake (or didn\u2019t get into IB), would you be able to 1) afford UMich 2) get into Ross? (I think the reverse isn\u2019t possible, since you wouldn\u2019t have your merit scholarship from USC anymore). Any other special programs you\u2019ve applied to at either school that you\u2019re waiting to hear from?  ```\n"
