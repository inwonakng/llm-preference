Most of my D\u2019s friends are in Terry but are neither FFR nor honors. The ones that graduated last year and the seniors had/have excellent internships and full time jobs lined up by senior year, comparable to IU. Most Kelley grads stay in the Midwest (Chicago mostly) and Terry grads stay in the South (Atlanta mostly). That\u2019s typical for big state schools.  Average/median salary differences not significant to begin with and are nonetheless due to cost of living differences. I would not decide based on USNews business rankings. Both are top notch business programs and your outcome from either will depend far more on what you do in college rather than whether you attend the higher ranked business program (IU is higher by 11 spots, which isn\u2019t worth even close to $100k difference). Also consider the difference in curriculum when considering fit.  ```\n"
