One thing to consider, even for good students, is that pre-med is time consuming. Having to work while in school is a huge disadvantage. If you go to medical school then at some point in the future you will have a similar choice: do I work where I fit or where the prestige is highest? At Harvard you will be a dime a dozen. At Georgia Tech they are rolling out the red carpet and pre-selecting you as a standout for whom they are providing a standout experience. In the future, do you take a job somewhere with low taxes, low cost of living, lots of autonomy but away from big city amenities; or do you live in a crappy condo, pay half your money in taxes, spend 10% of your life in traffic, but work at a prestigious facility? In the end, it is your call!  ```\n"
