How do the net costs compare for each school? Do you need to finance any of the costs with loans? Would you major in econ at both schools? Comparing the graduate outcomes is a good idea\u2013here is some 2017 data for Richmond https://careerservices.richmond.edu/post-graduation-data/index.html Both career centers will give you more details if you contact them. You might also take a look at the econ and/or business professors and their research focus\u2014what do you find most interesting? Also take a look at the course catalogs to compare curriculums and offerings. Richmond is more than double the size of Haverford in terms of students, with more of a pre-professional feel. The campus is beautiful and suburban. Haverford is also a nice campus but with more of an urban feel. Good luck!  ```\n"
