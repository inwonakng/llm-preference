Miidd is in the super elite lac division and haverford is close. Smith was but is no longer. Still great especially with the money. It still has cachet too don\u2019t get me wrong.  I would t make any of these choices around softball unless they were contingent for acceptance. Also if your D is lgbt Smith and Northampton are very accepting communities. As are the others too. Smith for the finances.  Middlebury for overall.  Haverford if she really wants an intellectual journey.  ```\n"
