Both have been on campus 4-5 times as over the last 2 years and both came away today impressed by the way the event was run and by the faculty they interacted with. Probably most importantly for them, they have never met an unfriendly or unhelpful kid; it seems the school does a great job of assembling a very diverse group of kids with big hearts, which to me means community and purpose focused - the new president emphasized this in his presentation and as leadership needs to come from the top it was good to hear. One DD left as a committed student athlete who felt like it is home, and the other, while still waiting on a couple of waitlist schools, felt like it could be the same for next four years and ultimately a lifetime.  ```\n"
