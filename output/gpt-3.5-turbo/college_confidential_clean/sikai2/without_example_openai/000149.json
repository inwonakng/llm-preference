This will be key. Had you taken calculus before you took statistics? (Reaching the highest possible level in math is crucial for business schools). Smeal is the most selective college at PSU - only about 10% students are pre-admits from high school. The regular path is DUS-&gt; qualifying classes=&gt; admission to Smeal as a junior. Your ECs are impressive and will be useful for the private universities you applied to. ECs matter for Schreyer but dont really matter for general university Admissions. In addition, this year was totally weird due to their adopting BOTH early action AND common app. Pitt is an excellent choice. Is it affordable? If so, you\u2019ve got a great safety.  ```\n"
