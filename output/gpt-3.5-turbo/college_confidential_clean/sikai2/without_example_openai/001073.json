The main difference i found between the two schools is that, on average, Stanford students and teachers are more driven and take their academics more seriously than those at USC. But that doesn\u2019t mean the students at Stanford are geniuses, or the student body at SC is unintellectual. I never got the sense that classes at Stanford were any more challenging than those at USC. After a few beers, anyone at any school can carry on a deeply intellectual conversation.  [quote] I will assume that this is a USC with full tuition scholarship versus full pay for Stanford thread in which cost is not a major factor. [/quote]  Since the title of the thread mentions that some schools are tuition-free while others are full-cost, I had the impression that money was an issue.  ```\n"
