Especially over the past five years, Uchicago has become an increasingly social place with more students who are career driven than ever before.  I was admitted to both this past March, and I ended up choosing Uchicago because of its excellent job placement in finance as well as its incredible econ program.  Choose to apply early to whichever one you feel the most comfortable at, since you cannot go wrong with either one.  ```\n"
