If your family is on the west coast they will have more of a chance to see you than at Princeton, and could probably attend some of your meets too. Flights  up and down the coast are very cheap and are essentially shuttle runs. You can\u2019t go wrong with either academically. You don\u2019t mention cost - is that an issue? Is there scholarship money involved at Stanford?  ```\n"
