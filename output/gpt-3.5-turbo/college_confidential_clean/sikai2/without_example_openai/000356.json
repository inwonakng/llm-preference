For instance, for 2016, 88.4% remained in engineering from freshman to sophomore years , 80.7% retention into third year. There is support if needed so a motivated student should be able to get at least to the 3.0 freshman  GPA that guarantees choice of major.  My son had no problem getting well above that threshold. Most kids that stay with engineering and put in the work  are able to get their choice of major .  ```\n"
