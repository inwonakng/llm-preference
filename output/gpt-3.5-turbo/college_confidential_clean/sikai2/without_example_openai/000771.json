With the exception of a few areas (CS electives at Mudd right now and some art classes), I\u2019ve not heard of students unable to get the cross registration courses they want.  Of course, you still have the issue that you\u2019d have at all colleges \u2014 frosh and soph register later and get slimmer pickings.  But JHU has that, too. No, I don\u2019t think there is a way around the CS electives issue at Mudd.  It isn\u2019t clear what all the steps are that will be taken to resolve it, and they are working on it, but it is possible that Mudd students might have an edge in getting those courses in the next couple of years. I don\u2019t have much opinion beyond that.  ```\n"
