I know a lot who made more than that and some who made less. If they\u2019re in finance then that seems like an okay estimate. Banks generally pay 140-200k all-in first year. Then it scales up. If you\u2019re in PE it\u2019s higher (250k in third year minimum but some pay up to 400k, and HFs even more). This a path that can be achieved at either Wharton or Stern, but is of course easier at Wharton. I don\u2019t mean to assert that. Lots of Stern kids do very well. Wharton does do better, but is it worth $184,000? I would say no. But I wouldn\u2019t go to Stern just because you plan to get an MBA.  ```\n"
