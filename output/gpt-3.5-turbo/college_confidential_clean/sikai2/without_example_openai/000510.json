[/quote]  You\u2019ve called attention to internal documents, not a comparative report. Kenyon\u2019s purpose in this case was to look directly, honestly and even harshly at their own institution for the determination of needed change. This should be regarded as a positive development. The analysis \u2013 though I haven\u2019t read it fully \u2013 does not appear intended to compare Kenyon to other colleges by the standards of social science. For the purposes of this thread, which requires meaningful comparisons across institutions, the documents would seem to provide little insight.  ```\n"
