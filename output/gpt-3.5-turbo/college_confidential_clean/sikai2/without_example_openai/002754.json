Most students are from the State of Michigan, there are not many International students, there are not many African Americans, there are not many Latinos. Compared to Cornell it is noticeable even to the casual observer.\"\" @rjkofnovi \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you are clueless.\u201d You think I am wrong that Michigan is a noticeably less diverse than Cornell? Can you be more specific about what you are disagreeing with? I thought it was obvious. I am surprised you are disagreeing with that.  ```\n"
