The brightest and best kids are at Berkeley. My daughter (graduating senior) used to always say one of the best parts of being at Berkeley were the students because they challenge each other to raise their game. She says everyone deserves to be there because they are all brilliant.\u201d You can\u2019t compare a giant state school to an elite private university. The best students at Berkeley are on par with the best students anywhere but there is much more variability at the bottom of the class. This is the price state schools pay for ensuring access to a great education. Berkeley\u2019s mission is very different from Duke\u2019s mission. Also, Duke has almost twice as many Rhodes scholars as Berkeley (despite being a fraction of the size). Not bad for a \u201cparty school\u201d. http://www.rhodesscholar.org/assets/uploads/2018%20RS_Number%20of%20Winners%20by%20Institution.pdf  ```\n"
