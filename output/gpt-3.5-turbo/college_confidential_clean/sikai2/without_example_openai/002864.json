I think Georgetown, Michigan and UVa are better options than JHU. McDonough, McIntire and Ross are three top 10 BBA programs, JHU does not have an established business program. Georgetown, Michigan and UVa have T14 Law schools of their own, and those Law schools seem to give preference to applicants from their own respective colleges. Also, all three seem to be better represented at other top law schools than JHU.  ```\n"
