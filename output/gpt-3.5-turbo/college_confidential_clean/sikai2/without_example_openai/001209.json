But I am not sure that I agree that Bowdoin is clearly better in your desired area of study\u2014I don\u2019t know. I do know that political science & government is the most popular major at Bowdoin & probably a very strong department, but that doesn\u2019t mean that WashUStl is not strong in those areas. As you know, one school has 1,800 undergraduates & the other has almost 7,000 undergraduates. The larger school should have a wider variety of course offerings. An important factor in favor of Bowdoin College is the 12 school exchange program which allows Bowdoin students to study for a semester or a year at other member schools which includes Dartmouth College, Amherst, Williams Mystic Seaport Program, Wesleyan, Wellesley, Smith, and 5 other schools The other schools are Connecticut College, Mount Holyoke College, Trinity College, Vassar College & Wheaton College\u2026  ```\n"
