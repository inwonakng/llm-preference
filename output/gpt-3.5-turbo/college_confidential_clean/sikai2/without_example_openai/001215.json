Bowdoin\u2019s classes will generally be smaller, but that is a common advantage of LACs over U\u2019s and no knock on Wash U. Wash U will offer more majors and classes. Would you rather be in a semi-urban/suburban environment, or a small-town/rural environment? The outdoor charms of Maine or the city experience of St. Louis? These student bodies, from what I have read, seem fairly well balanced \u2013 maybe a bit more nerdy than jocky, but both have their preppy side too. You can have fun at both, but neither is known as a particularly rabid party school. The biggest differences will be some standard LAC/U differences and their settings/environments.  ```\n"
