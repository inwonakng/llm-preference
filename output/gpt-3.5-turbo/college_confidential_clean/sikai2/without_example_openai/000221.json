Lots of weed out classes.  (And possibly a bit too much partying.). Google \u201cPSU engineering entrance to major requirements\u201d for details. Some majors require GPAs as high as 3.2. 2 and #3 - As your email or letter states, you were accepted into the COLLEGE but with an intended major...but not directly into the major.  You are technically in what PSU calls premajor status. To officially declare your major, you will have to successfully complete several courses with a C or better and hit a certain overall GPA, which varies depending on your major.  Civil engineering requires a 2.6 but biomedical, mechanical,  and chemical require a 3.2.  My advice is to go to office hours, sign up for Lion tutors, create peer study groups, etc.  and try to do as many math courses as possible at your community college over the summer and transfer them in. Just make sure you confirm with an adviser that they will be accepted before doing so. 4 - PSU engineeeing is super tough but they are in high demand.  Alumni network is the largest outside of Michigan and so the brand name goes far.  ```\n"
