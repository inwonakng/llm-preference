I say that because the Trojan Family Alumni net work is very strong in the west. Harvard is Harvard, and a degree there is known everywhere. But neither a Stanford or Harvard degree is worth $300000 more than a degree from USC. If he is going to major in Economics then save the $$ for an MBA, or a MS in Economics. Both will cost you a LOT.  ```\n"
