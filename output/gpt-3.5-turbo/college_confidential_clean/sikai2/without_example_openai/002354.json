My point is this: a school like Columbia is a luxury, and an expensive one if you have to pay full price. It provides some benefits Michigan doesn\u2019t, the chief of which (in my opinion) is a set of more academically accomplished peers (compare the two on https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/compare-colleges) to see the difference here. That is a factor that matters a lot to some people, and much less to others. The difference is not all that great when we\u2019re talking about Michigan, which is a top public, and perhaps even less if a student is definitely interested in CS (or engineering). The decision is actually not a \u201cno-brainer\u201d for a thoughtful person. But it does boil down to how much you\u2019re willing and able to spend for a luxury item.  ```\n"
