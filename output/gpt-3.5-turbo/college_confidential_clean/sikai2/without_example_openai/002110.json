If you have not been accepted into the HC, then you have not been accepted as pre-IB. (You aren\u2019t even accepted directly into IB.  I think if your GPA drops below a 3.5, IB as a jr is no longer an option.) The IB program is incredibly competitive.  If you aren\u2019t admitted as an incoming freshman, the admissions is fierce and requires a minimum of a 3.6 or 3.7 to even apply.  (I can\u2019t remember exactly.  I sat in on a presentation last yr and the details are fuzzy.  Since it didn\u2019t apply to my dd, it wasn\u2019t a focus.) To give you an idea, my dd is a Top Scholar who was accepted into pre-IB bc of the HC admissions.  She is also part of one of their cohort students.  She only has until Feb of this yr (freshman) to decide if she wants to stay in the cohort or switch to classic IB.  If she changes her mind March or later that she doesn\u2019t want to be in her cohort, she completely loses her IB spot.  ```\n"
