I can\u2019t imagine any sane person preferring Chicago weather. UChicago is quite strong in political science. Stanford may be even stronger, but not by obvious leaps and bounds for undergraduates. For social science overall, UChicago is one of the strongest research universities in the world. Undergraduate instruction in UChicago\u2019s social science and humanities Core classes, which take up about 1/3 of the college  program, is about as good as you\u2019re likely to find anywhere (in terms of course content, class size, and instructor quality.)  ```\n"
