Now I\u2019m going to say something absolutely profound to the OP.  So amazing, many posters may need to hide their eyes: OP is going to do extremely well, no matter which world class university is chosen.  As cost is evidently not a concern (an extremely fortunate position to be in that does not apply to most students), I\u2019m going to recommend OP go with the best fit, and also, Go Blue!  ```\n"
