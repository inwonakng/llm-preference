Unless money is not a consideration or Duke gives you enough assistance to bring it to Berkeley\u2019s level, this should certainly figure into your equation. The other things you need to consider is how certain you want to pursue engineering/CS and how much you want the type of college experience that a school like Duke can provide. They are both great schools, but if you are looking for that quintessential college experience (school spirit, sports, Greek life) and want a strong liberal arts curriculum, Duke is probably a better choice.  ```\n"
