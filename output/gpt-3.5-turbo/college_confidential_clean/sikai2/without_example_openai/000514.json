We live in Ohio and most of the students at her high school chose to attend OSU, OhioU, Miami U or Dayton. The drinking/party culture at those schools did not appeal to her and she was looking for a very different college experience. Vasser, Grinnell, Carleton were all on her list\u2014 she was looking for many of the same things the OP noted. I will tell you so far, she has nothing but excellent things to say about Kenyon\u2014 she absolutely loves it. She says there are plenty of things to do on the weekend besides go to parties\u2026 often times so many different things that she has to choose one over the other when she\u2019d like to do both. And in addition, my introverted kid says she actually enjoys going to the parties on campus\u2026 they are fun, \u201cpeople actually dance\u201d lol her words, and sometimes she chooses to have a beer and other times not. No one cares either way. She\u2019s an athlete and enjoys hanging out with the team, but also has other friends she goes out with as well. She is busy all the time\u2026 I wish she\u2019d call more! We are extremely close so it\u2019s an adjustment not hearing from her every day but I am so thankful she is loving Kenyon as much as she is and is not homesick (yet at least!) I know it\u2019s still early, but I honestly didn\u2019t think the adjustment to college would be so smooth. She says it is an incredibly supportive community and the people there are very down to earth, interesting and like minded when it comes to being serious about genuinely learning new things etc. Interestingly enough tonight when I called she had just come from a mandatory meeting at her dorm (bi monthly I believe) called beer and sex LOL where they talk about drinking responsibly on campus etc. So it seems the administration is not blind to what from my perspective seems like \u201caverage\u201d college drinking\u2026 but then I\u2019m comparing it to what I know about schools like Dayton and OU\u2026 where drinking is pretty much the only weekend activity available. Just the perspective of one student\u2026 but this was a thread I would have stalked like a hawk a year ago when we were looking, and I am so glad she made the decision to attend Kenyon\u2014 So much so my middle child is considering it after seeing how happy her big sis is.  ```\n"
