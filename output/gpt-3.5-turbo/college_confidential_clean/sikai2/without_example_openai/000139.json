Haverford is a small, distinctive community based on Quaker traditions of community and tolerance. While Haverford and Bryn Mawr students can take classes at Penn, that only applies to Arts and Sciences type classes \u2013 Wharton and Engineering classes are excluded \u2013 and is limited to classes which are not generally offered at Haverford and Bryn Mawr. I would discourage selecting Haverford with the idea that it is a \u201cback door\u201d to Penn. For a student who wants a business major and is not excited by the Haverford culture, Richmond sounds like the better option.  ```\n"
