My daughter never felt unsafe on campus or nearby. However as with any campus she knew she had to use good sense, not travel alone at night, etc. Vanderbilt has the Vandy Vans which run late at night and you can always request an escort. Safety on any campus should not be taken lightly no matter where she goes.  ```\n"
