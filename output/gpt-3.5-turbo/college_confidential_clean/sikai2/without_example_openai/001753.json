[/quote]  $280,000 is not easy to replace even for the upper middle and lower upper class (maybe the plutocrat class considers it to be pocket change, though).  If the OP\u2019s parents would have trouble funding their retirement if they spent that on the OP\u2019s college, that should cause the OP to hesitate when there is a good full ride available.  ```\n"
