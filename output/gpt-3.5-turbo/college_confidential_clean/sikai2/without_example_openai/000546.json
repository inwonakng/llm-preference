You\u2019ll be in classes with similar students\u2014ones much like yourself\u2014at both schools.  You\u2019ll have professors who are equally good at what they do and demanding of their students at both schools.  You\u2019ll cover the same content and get the same kind of foundational knowledge for MCAT prep at both schools. My daughter had similar high-school stats to yours, and she\u2019s had to work diligently to maintain a GPA in the 3.8 range.  She\u2019s taking a gap year to get more clinical experience and study for MCATS (study abroad did make it hard to take the test spring of junior year).  So far, her friends who did apply during this med-school app cycle have been happy with their results. Emory was on her \u201cshort list,\u201d but ultimately she chose Rochester.  She loves Rochester and has been prepared well for med school there through classes, research work, volunteering, internships, and ECs.  But, truth to tell, if she had chosen Emory, I\u2019m sure she would have been equally happy and equally well-prepared there.  ```\n"
