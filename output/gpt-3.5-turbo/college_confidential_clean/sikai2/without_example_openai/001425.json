[/quote]  No. I know Northwestern is a great school, but I don\u2019t really associate it with the natural sciences.  Economics and journalism come to mind when I think of Northwestern. When I think of Vanderbilt, I think of health sciences first. That\u2019s probably because the medical school is such a big part of the campus, and when I visit my daughter in Nashville, there are always stories on the news and advertisements about the Vanderbilt Hospital.  ```\n"
