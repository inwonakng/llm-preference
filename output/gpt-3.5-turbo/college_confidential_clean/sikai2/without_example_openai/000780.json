You will be surprised at the response. JHU does have more lay and professional name recognition than Pomona at the professional level which will help if you do not choose to go to grad school.  It also helps that all of the FANG companies recruit on campus for JHU - not sure if the same is true for Pomona (doubtful).  JHU\u2019s comp sci major is also world renowned (especially for cyber security) and small which helps tremendously.  It doesn\u2019t help that Pomona\u2019s CS program is not even ABET accredited let alone recognized. To say JHU\u2019s reputation is primarily medical is a bit shortsighted.  JHU is well known in silicon valley - far more from my subjective experience versus any LAC given none of them having an engineering school save for Mudd (which is also a relative unknown).  It helps that JHU\u2019s ex-president is heavily involved in the community and Stanford (Will Brody).  And it doesn\u2019t hurt that IBM\u2019s ex ceo and chairman of the board (Samuel J. Palmisano) is a JHU alum. Contrary to @nostalgicwisdom  Go to US News and compare JHU to Pomona: Alumni giving rank: #6 amongst all universities (37.5%) vs Pomona (27.6%) 54th amongst all LACs. Academic Reputation: JHU (4.6) Top 5 amongst all universities versus 4.4 for Pomona - top 20 amongst LACs. Disclaimer:  Former JHU undergrad alum and MIT grad alum working at Google now in Mountain View.  I would choose JHU in a heartbeat and it also helps they wanted you first.  If you tell people in the valley you majored at Comp Sci at Pomona, a non-insignificant amount would have assumed you went to Calpoly Pomona since the latter actually has an engineering school.  No need to make that distinction with Hopkins. As for the network, yes it exists.  I and several other JHU grads have referred fellow JHU alums to Google.  We have an SF JHU young alumni chapter that takes care of other alums for tech jobs too. Pomona isn\u2019t even the top ranked LAC in US News and it does not compare to Hopkins from a CS level.  ```\n"
