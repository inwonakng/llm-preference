But UMich is not Alabama St.  I consider UMich to be a Near-Ivy and only a handful of MIT admits would have gotten a full-ride from a Near-Ivy/Ivy-equivalent. Those are incredibly rare and difficult to get (if you don\u2019t count the all-female schools and military academies).  Between them, Rice, Duke, UChicago, Caltech, Oberlin, UMich (for OOS), and UVa (for OOS) probably offer fewer than 200 full-rides total.  ```\n"
