It is true that Columbia does not produce detailed salary data, but Penn and Cornell do, as does Michigan, but I would assume Columbia is similar to Penn and Cornell. Others have said it is cost of living that causes Michigan salaries to be lower, but that does not make sense to me because CS majors at top schools all seem to be moving to the same cities. I have no doubt that the best Michigan students can compete with anyone and can command salaries in the $110k - $150k range. However, I suspect that the average and below average Michigan students may not be so competitive and that may bring their average down. To me it appears that there is just not enough information to tell why the Michigan average is lower. Maybe you have some insight?
