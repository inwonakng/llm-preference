Period,  Even Reed acknowledges that fact.  Putting your head in the sand and saying rankings don\u2019t make any difference is ridiculous.  BTW, Reed does participate is rankings it does like, not that it is hypocritical or anything.  Whether you \u201clike\u201d rankings or not isn\u2019t germane to this discussion, in fact any ranking (or polls for that matter) system to include sports, colleges, etc will always be controversial.  ```\n"
