I have a kid at an Ivy in a different sport. From California as well and wanted a different culture.  It\u2019s working out ok for him there and the deciding factor was the major, school culture, the team competitiveness and team culture. One thing to seriously consider is the weather especially given that yours is an outdoor sport. My kid would compete in 30-40 degree weather and that was in the spring. Not ideal but it is what it is. The other factor (which may or may not be important to you) is the racial mix of the student body. You mention you had unforgettable feelings about being on princeton\u2019s campus which is great but you bring up a good point that you\u2019re a teenager and might not trust your feelings. You may have that feeling now but there\u2019s always a honeymoon period then reality sets in once practice and school starts and the grind becomes that\u2026a grind. Your teammmates will really shape your experience during your undergrad much more than anything else. I\u2019d give the nod to Stanford: prestige, high quality academics, weather and PAC-12 athletics.  Good luck! P.S. Now that my kid has had some experience as an Ivy athlete coming from another coast, the  drawback has been distance. The lack of family support at meets was evident and the struggle was real. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s contributed to some positive takeaways such as character building but I have to agree with @TooOld4School  ```\n"
