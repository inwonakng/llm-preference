Best case at Harvard is at least 80K of debt when you finish, if not more.  Then pay for med school on top of that? GT is a great school and will leave you very well prepared to move on to med school without the huge burden of student loans.  Before you choose Harvard, run some financial calculators so you can see for yourself what the real cost is of those loans.  You\u2019ll wind up paying over $150K for that 80K loan if you take 20 years to pay it off.  That\u2019s hundreds of dollars a month that will NOT go to a mortgage, or to investments, or in your own future kid\u2019s college fund.  Don\u2019t do it.  ```\n"
