Penn engineering has about 435 students per class while Yale has 108. Still you will have access to professors, TAs at both. I never felt i didn\u2019t have access to my professors at Penn and all classes are taught by professors who also hold regular office hours. The fact that there are more students interested in STEM meant more STEM- oriented student organizations and more like-minded people to learn from. Penn engineering is still at a very manageable size (435 per class is not a lot) but also quite diverse because of its size. Also i feel the research opportunities and stem-related extracurricular involvement are more robust and diverse.  ```\n"
