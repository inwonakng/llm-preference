You could look up professor ratings, recent graduate placements, etc., but in the end it will be more about what you do when you\u2019re there than what others have done or think.  If you\u2019re down to a few schools\u2026go where you feel like you belong.  If you are engaged with the professors and other students, you\u2019ll be well positioned when you\u2019re ready to leave.  Don\u2019t over think it.  ```\n"
