We are OOS she has been admitted to other schools as well, but has not made her decision. I am a graduate of UVA\u2019s Mcintire School of Commerce (admit rate is like 60% now and there is a tuition bump of 5K if you attend McIntire for your 3rd and 4th year, so that is something to consider).  Back in the day, The Comm School was amazing\u2013great professors, case studies/group work, and a smaller school within the larger university).  Now, the school is state of the art and job prospects or grads are great.  I also think there is pre-law advising at UVA, which may be helpful.  Of course, my preference is UVA.  Charlottesville is a great college town and, at 16K students vs. 26K students, is much smaller than Michigan.  Most of my classes were pretty small (except Econ 201, etc.) and I think they are even more keyed-in on low faculty to student ratio now.  The campus is beautiful and historic.  She visited Michigan in Feb last year and it was -10.  Charlottesville weather is more mild of course.  As an alum, I am really hoping our March visit for Days on the Lawn is impressive and that D chooses UVA\u2013not just because her mom attended!  Wahoowa!  ```\n"
