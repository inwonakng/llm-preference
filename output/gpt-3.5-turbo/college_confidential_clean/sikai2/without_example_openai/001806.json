A bachelors is still a bachelors whether it\u2019s MIT or Michigan.  If you check professional job listings, you\u2019ll see that there is no distinction between schools, in fact the bachelors is just a minimum requirement.  Experience is where the money and career grows.  If you go for the scholarship at Michigan, you could still use part of that money for a master\u2019s degree, which would squash an MIT bachelors any day of the week.  ```\n"
