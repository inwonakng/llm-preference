However if your school didn\u2019t offer calc and your GC indicated you took \u2018thevmet rigorous\u2019 curriculum at your school, you wouldn\u2019t be penalized. Look, it\u2019s not your fault since apparently you had no guidance. Have you received financial aid packages? Is Pitt affordable? Last year there was a first Gen student (first to go to college) who ended up stuck because hed been admitted to Pitt and wasn\u2019t affordable\u2026   ```\n"
