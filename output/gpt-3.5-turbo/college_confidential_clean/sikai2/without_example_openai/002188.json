Just looking at 2017 IRA champs, Princeton men crushed Stanford.  Of the 3 V8 boats Princeton was in the grand final with each boat, and Stanford was in the third final with each boat.  That is not to say you should go to Princeton.  The competition to get a seat will likely be much tougher at Princeton.  There is still much more rowing depth in the east than the west.  ```\n"
