Lol\u2026) Times change. And they will change again. And some more after that. Go where you feel you\u2019ll most at home (or, if you\u2019re not sure, go to UMich - {and for sure don\u2019t listen to the chicken littles around here, UMich is not going anywhere, certainly not in 4 years\u2026 It\u2019s a lot of money if you don\u2019t love Columbia/NYC, even if you just save it for your parent\u2019s retirment.) Or as if you can use the extra money to go abroad, or do something cool.  ```\n"
