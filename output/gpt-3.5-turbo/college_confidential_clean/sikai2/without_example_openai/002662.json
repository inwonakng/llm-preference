Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```@helpless2017 GT Honors program is not the same and as exclusive, as Presidents Scholarship program (my son was interviewed for PS, but not selected). Several of his closest friends are from his freshman HP dorm, and it was nice to see him excited about some of the humanities courses he had a chance to take. I would say that he is pretty integrated into GT community now, especially into College of Computing community, where they do exceptional job with internships, co-ops, and many other things, including student support. All his summer internships, starting freshman year, were interesting and paid ones, and with well known companies. There are so many different activities to balance intense academic life. He is passionate about hackathons, so that kinda takes him everywhere now, and goes beyond GT community. Congratulations, and good luck!  ```\n"
