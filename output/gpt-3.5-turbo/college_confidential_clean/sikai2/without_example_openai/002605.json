A lot has changed in both universities since then. The Bloomberg article gets several things wrong (especially the title). I have a son each at Yale and Stanford, and virtually all my son\u2019s peers who wanted silicon valley internships got one. For instance, Facebook, Google and Microsoft were among the top-10 employers at the school last year, while several others are in CS grad programs at Berkeley, MIT and Columbia. (http://ocs.yale.edu/connect/statistics). Yale is also expanding both it\u2019s engineering and CS faculty, and they have already grown by 20-30% across all departments over the last few years.  ```\n"
