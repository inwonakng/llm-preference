I was just there last week and drove through the CMU campus.   If the expensive privates remain on the table, it might be a good idea to reinforce with your son that you do not intend to pay for graduate studies if he goes to a full pay private .  He may be hoping  you would change your mind on that (and maybe you would?) .  If there are younger siblings that also need to be factored in, consider the precedent that is set by the older one 's choices/options.  Good luck!  ```\n"
