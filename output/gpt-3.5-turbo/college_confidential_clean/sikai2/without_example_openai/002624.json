Not sure I trust Parchment, which reports that Columbia takes 15% of cross-admits with Stanford; UCLA, 12%, Berkeley, 13%; Duke, 15%; Brown, 21%; Penn, 28%; USC, 9%. The linked document suggests that each of these schools claimed less than 10% of cross-admits in 2014, when Stanford had a lower yield rate. https://stanford.app.box.com/s/y4abufqg66nte7uax6eq N.B.II. 95% confidence intervals notwithstanding. N.B.III. Suspect that the Stanford data are completer and more comprehensive than those for most other schools.  ```\n"
