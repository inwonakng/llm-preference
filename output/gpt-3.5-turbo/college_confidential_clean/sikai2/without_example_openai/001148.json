Did you apply to Marshall? Are the other schools transfer decision\u2019s out yet - have you been accepted into them and need to make a decision on one or the other right away? Point is I think the answer for now is BC or UNC - choose between them, then make it a choice between USC and that winner when the time comes. Comparing two at a time is easier so things don\u2019t get jumbled in your head.  ```\n"
