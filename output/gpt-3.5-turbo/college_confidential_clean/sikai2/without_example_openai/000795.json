We aren\u2019t comparing grad schools here but merely available undergrad opportunities.  I think hopkins offers a half off masters should you choose that path later to its undergrads too.  What you need to consider right now is how CS majors like the school at both jhu and Pomona.  Not a single poster thus far has addressed that point adequately in this thread.  Get more data points.  ```\n"
