A: For the fall of 2015, 5,371 students applied for admission to the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and 390 were offered admission. Nine percent (9%) of the applicants accepted completed their undergraduate work at the University of Pittsburgh. In the same year, the first year class consisted of 148 students. Fourteen percent (14%) of the first year class completed their undergraduate work at the University of Pittsburgh. ** Based on my D1\u2019s class of GAP admits, she would say around 50% joined her at Pitt Med, rest either did not qualify or left for other opportunities. And yes, getting a 3.75 cGPA for Science subjects, even for the smartest of students, is not a cakewalk.  ```\n"
