[/quote]  Have to admit I\u2019m stunned.  Any idea where they got that info?  If true, I had no idea they produced so many and it could be another reason why they are considered an engineering powerhouse.  Granted, H is one of them as he\u2019s had his PE for years, but still, one out of five from VT?  (Note if anyone missed it that this is PE  - professional engineers - not just engineering graduates.)  Still\u2026 where are the stats?  (Google has not been helpful.) The statement comes from this page: https://eng.vt.edu/admissions.html  ```\n"
