The only things that seem to attract you to HMC are the fact that you can have an engineering degree and the Claremont Consortium - but Amherst is in the Five College Consortium. You can also start working right after undergrad from Amherst - you don\u2019t need a graduate degree just because you don\u2019t go into engineering. Most college students do start working right after college, especially from a college like Amherst.  ```\n"
