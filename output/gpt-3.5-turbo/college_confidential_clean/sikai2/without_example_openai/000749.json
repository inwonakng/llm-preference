Although falling out of favor, typically 40% to 50% of Wharton grads got their MBAs at ages 27 through 29. Hard to believe that those high income earners would give up their positions to return for two years of school, however, unless wanting to change employers and careers, or their careers hit a roadblock due to not having an MBA. Very recently that figure has fallen to 27% of Wharton grads going back to school for MBAs at ages 27 to 29. OP: In short, if $184,000 plus interest means nothing to you, then feel free to go to Wharton. But, if you are going to major in finance, NYU Stern will put you in competition for the same jobs as a Wharton finance major.  ```\n"
