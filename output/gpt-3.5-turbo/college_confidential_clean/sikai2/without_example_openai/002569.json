I think either school will prepare you for pursuing a doctorate.  I\u2019d consider the differences in the departments to be a wash.  If you are going to a LAC it\u2019s because to want to study physics and Russian Lit, or philosophy, or whatever the best professors on campus are teaching. Consider broadening your comparison.  ```\n"
