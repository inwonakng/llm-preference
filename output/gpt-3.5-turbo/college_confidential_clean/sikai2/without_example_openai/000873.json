BU has an urban campus connected to the city (albeit a pretty self contained one confined to a stretch of Commonwealth Ave), whereas BC has a traditional (and very beautiful) collegiate campus ~30 minutes out by public transit. Acknowledging the limits of stereotypes, BU kids are typically seen as trendier and more individualistic, whereas BC kids maintain a preppier, more mainstream image. BU students interact more with local schools, particularly MIT, than do BC kids by virtue of proximity. Contrary to the previous post, I would say BU has made proportionally far greater strides in selectivity than BC; BC has been top-notch for some time, while BU just recently caught up to a similar standard of selectivity. The incoming GPAs and standardized test scores are nearly identical, and BU has a ~6 percentage point lower acceptance rate likely because it draws from a comparitively more extensive international applicant pool. Considering BU\u2019s momentum relative BC, BU will likely make up the 5 spot difference in US News rankings and leapfrog BC by the time you graduate - if rankings are important to you / employers in your prospective field. BC and BU have a similar endowment (~2 bil), but BU shares that amongst roughly twice the student population. BU\u2019s Kilachand center (CILSE) has the same focus on interdisciplinarity, and it was endowed with $100 million dollars by a donation last year that will mean it will dependably pump out ~$5 million in research per year at minimum. BU conducted $400 million in research last year, and BC conducted $193 million. Overall, BU typically carries more weight in the sciences. Case in point, do research on your intended major/career, gauge which one would fit your vibe best, and know you\u2019re picking between two great options.  ```\n"
