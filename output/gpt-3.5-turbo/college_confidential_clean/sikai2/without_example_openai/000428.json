Part of the reason is that many refuse to pay high MBA tuitions plus sacrifice an income for 2 years during a full time MBA program. Today, many expect an undergraduate business degree to deliver what an MBA used to be used for. This has also given rise to one year specialty masters degrees in business such as marketing, marketing research, finance, data analytics, etc. instead of pursuing the traditional 2 year full time MBA.  ```\n"
