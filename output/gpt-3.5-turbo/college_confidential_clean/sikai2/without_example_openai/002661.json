      "content": "College A: ```Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```Olin only has about 320 students \u2026 so sometimes I think of almost as a very large co-ed frat.   There is a tendency for students to stay on campus.   The academic and project load is intense (as it would be at GT too I\u2019m sure), but the students seem to thrive on the challenge.   They are often on that Olin bubble, but liking it.   Having said that, my son did get off campus.  One of his research things was  joint project with Wellesly.    I\u2019d guess he went to Boston about once a month.  He rode his bike and ran a lot too.   For him, most interests/ECs involved music, which he did on campus.   Oh yea, he also tutored some local kids and did a morning math(?) program at a local school. \u201cI love meeting new people and working with those who are different from me.\u201d -   That definitely could be a concern regarding \u201cfit\u201d.    The Oliners have a wide variety of interests, more so than in many engineering programs.  But they are still all very STEM-focused.   To give an example, there is a Saturday night club called \u201cMidnight Mathematicians\u201d.   I kid you not\u2026 they meet at midnight and take turns presenting on math topics.  ```\n"
