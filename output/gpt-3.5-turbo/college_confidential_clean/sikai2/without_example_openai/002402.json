At least as good as Bates, Midd, and Bowdoin, and maybe better. A lot of people are forced to skip Williams on their college visits because it is too far off the beaten track to fit into their schedule. But if you love the outdoors, then a remote location in a snowy mountainous corner of New England may be exactly what you are looking for.  [quote] Middlebury- awesome location in the mountains, lovely campus. [/quote]  Williams is even closer to the mountains. On the other hand, Midd arguably does have a lovelier, more carefully planned campus. The Williams campus seems somewhat randomly organized and has a two-lane highway running through the middle.  ```\n"
