Plus the average is not six figures unfortunately within all of CS.  Only google and Facebook primarily offers that to entry grads and the salary is low 100k plus stock options that can\u2019t be realized for some time.  Not to gloat, but 100k is tough to save on in the Bay Area where these companies are located.  MV rent for a nice one bedroom with amenities is around $3k average per month for instance.  ```\n"
