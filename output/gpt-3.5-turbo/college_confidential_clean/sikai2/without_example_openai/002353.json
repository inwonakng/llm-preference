This year is the first time I have seen a 21 year old undergrad with a CS offer of $100k+ salary and another $100k+ in onboarding (signing bonus + relocation + stock/options). The talented CS kids seem to be really cleaning up this year. Are you seeing that more broadly?\u201d I can\u2019t really speak for companies outside of bay area, stocks are used as a differentiator out here and also to help these young kids get some money for housing :-).  So it\u2019s tough to say whether Google uses stocks outside the bay area where they don\u2019t run into other companies offering stock as a key part of their compensation.  ```\n"
