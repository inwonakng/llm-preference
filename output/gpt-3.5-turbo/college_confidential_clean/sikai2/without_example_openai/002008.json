That is just a fact (look at the standardized test scores) [/quote]  This is pure ignorance. I\u2019m sorry that I had to say that. Here\u2019s why. Berkeley weighs HS GPAs more than it does standardized test scores, while Duke does the reverse. One can take SATs twice and submit the highest scores \u2013 we call that, super-scoring. Duke is notoriously known to have been employing that tactic. Now, if you can show me any data that says Duke has a higher SAT score than Berkeley College of Engineering, I will concede.  ```\n"
