(Hence the logo mashup) But I\u2019ve known about Pomona for a long time. One of my best friends in HS (on the east coast) went to Pomona for undergrad and is now a Dean at a top 20 University. It has been a top-notch school for a very long time. I don\u2019t have much direct experience with JHU, though, other than friends who went there for medical-related postgrad programs. Yes, the popularity of CS programs at Mudd and Pomona has led to staffing and course-registration issues.  Majors get priority for required classes, but not for additional electives beyond the requirements, and people are understandably unhappy about this. Hopefully some solutions will be found, but it is an issue.  ```\n"
