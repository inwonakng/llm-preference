Siblings only count to reduce the EFC at Georgetown if they are enrolled in an undergrad program. Feel free to go in person, but I don\u2019t get the idea that there is a lot of flexibility from the FA office. They have been responsive, but not budging. They advised us that they do not consider scholarships awarded from other universities. We received a good package, but year 4 is making it look  impossible because my EFC will go up 40% (GU explained that they split the EFC between two kids as 60/40) ```\n"
