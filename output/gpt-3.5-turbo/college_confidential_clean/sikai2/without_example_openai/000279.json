The question I had however is - do all freshmen take the same courses in first year or for Mechanical engineering you have your own set of major courses and for CS I  have my own set - which is ok to do and we maintain the GPA for these courses. Its also  ok if there are a few general courses However if both departments are taking same set of courses it means many will get weeded out from the major they want isnt it? Purdue and TAMU and Vtech states clearly that first year is General engg where all freshmen take same courses right? However Calpoly SLO - you are taking classes related to CS from Day 1. I would like someone to confirm if at Penn State - all freshmen are taking same set of classes or the set of classes pertaining to their major with a few common ones. This is important for making my decision. Can anyone please confirm?  ```\n"
