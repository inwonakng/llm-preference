It\u2019s a great deal. But, I don\u2019t know your financial situation. If you\u2019re really wanting to take some business classes, Richmond\u2019s business school is quite good (and beautiful). They have Bloomberg terminals, a student managed investment fund, and a club that focuses on Wall Street IB placement. This coming year, they are adding a data analytics major. Lots of kids double major, and Richmond has a unique leadership school. The school has a great network. My guess is that Haverford is more intellectual, Richmond more preprofessional, though you would have your Scholar cohorts.  ```\n"
