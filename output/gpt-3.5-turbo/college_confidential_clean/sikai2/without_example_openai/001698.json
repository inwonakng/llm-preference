When I took my son there, he had to practically scrape his jaw off off of the floor. The facilities there are so impressive.  I have not toured the engineering facilities at Duke, but I can\u2019t imagine that they can compare to Michigan\u2019s, especially in ME.  My son was ready to dive right in during the tour of the project team facility.  I know that you said you are using engineering as a means to an end, but since you will be doing it for 4 years, you should consider what kinds of opportunities there are for exploration during your UG years. You might actually like engineering and want to actually do it for a while.  ```\n"
