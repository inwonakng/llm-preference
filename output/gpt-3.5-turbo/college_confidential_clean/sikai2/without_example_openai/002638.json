There are only so many slots, and legacies generally need to be brilliant or connected nowadays. As I\u2019ve said elsewhere, it\u2019s in the interest of the universities for the alumni to think the preference is big enough to be meaningful, and for everyone else to think it\u2019s so small as to be irrelevant. As a result, between two-thirds and 80% of legacies (who are generally more qualified than the average applicant) are denied, which still translates to significantly better odds than non-legacy applicants face. That\u2019s a topic for other threads, though. ```\n"
