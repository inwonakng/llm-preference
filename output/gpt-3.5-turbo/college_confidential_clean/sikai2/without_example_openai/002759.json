Combining African American, Latino, Asian, and International students, Cornell has a total of 46%, while Michigan is only at 30%. It is definitely noticeable to me on campus that Cornell has over 50% more students in these groups than Michigan does. It may not seem to be that significant in individual categories, but Michigan is at the low end of the range in each category, and it adds up. I think Michigan does a great job for a midwestern state flagship, but Michigan is viewed more as an elite national university than a state flagship, and by that standard, they are close to the bottom of the barrel in this category. ```\n"
