Plus, I did not calculate that OP would be earning $300,000 per year (your figure) in years 3 & 4 after undergraduate school. OP has already saved $184,000 plus interest on undergraduate study; Probably get at least a 50% MBA scholarship very possibly higher than 50%; More reasonable loss of earnings after tax for 2 year = $200,000; (A Penn Wharton MBA starts at $147,000 salary & bonus, but OP would not have a Penn Wharton MBA\u2013just a BS/BA).  ```\n"
