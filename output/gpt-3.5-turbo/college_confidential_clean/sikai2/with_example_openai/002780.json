I LOVE that building. They host all kinds of events there, not just religious services. I think the stained glass windows are very special, because they feature great thinkers from history, rather than Christian iconography. Overall, Bates is inclusive. It\u2019s prides itself on inclusivity, and if you read its history, you will see why. @lookingforward , yes, there are conservatives, and the NY Times managed to find a Trump voter during the election, which made me smile. Clayton Spencer has been true to her word, the paryting has been diminished. Trick or Drink is relegated to history. I think a lot of it has been due to improving relations with Lewiston. I know that a lot of Bates kids volunteer in the schools, not sure how recent that is. Poor D didn\u2019t even go out this weekend. She has three essays and two exams in the next few days. She is looking forward to playing with puppies and getting free massages so that she can chill out a little during finals week! @hopeful1660 , just saw your post. No, D is not an athlete and has zero interest. Bates has about 40% athletes, I believe. Atheltics are very important to the school, and I suspectbits to keep the alumni happy in large part. D was worried about athletes. Her concerns were unfounded. She would say that everyone just gets along. No competitiveness, definitrly no slacking though. D mades the Dean\u2019s list, which 25% of students achieve. She loves it. She likes being around other smart, motivated kids. @Chembiodad Bates has an extremely high rate of grad school acceptance. It is number 5 in producing Fulbright Scholars. Cornell produced 15, Bates had 13 last year. Given its size, that\u2019s a heck of an achievement. I think Bates doesn\u2019t care too much about USNWR. It does things the way it wants to, and always has.  ```\n"
