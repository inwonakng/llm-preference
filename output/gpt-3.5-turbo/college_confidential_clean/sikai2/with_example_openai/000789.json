I don\u2019t believe LACs without engineering are even eligible to apply, since ABET is an engineering based institution. As mentioned, the CS outcomes from Pomona are phenomenal, with students readily landing tech jobs at the top companies and graduate school destinations. If there\u2019s some evidence that Pomona CS students are suffering in comparison to students from other schools, I\u2019d like to see it. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, and Alphabet all recruit across the 5Cs, and while I don\u2019t believe Netflix does, I just found 10 Pomona alumni who are presently working there and 7 at Mudd through LinkedIn. I could easily reach out to them. Tech recruiting is not something that the CCs are weak at. And as previously mentioned, I\u2019ve never heard of anyone from Pomona complaining that their education did not serve them well for grad school.   I was referring to this: http://www.forbes.com/sites/schifrin/2017/08/02/2017-grateful-grads-index-top-200-best-loved-colleges/   It\u2019s silly to discount Pomona as \u201cisn\u2019t even the top ranked LAC in US News\u201d. Johns Hopkins \u201cisn\u2019t even the top ranked university in US News\u201d, so don\u2019t bother with them. Doesn\u2019t that sound absurd? If we\u2019re going by rankings that actually are combined, Forbes ranks Pomona 10th (including the #1 LAC) and Hopkins 30th, while Times/WSJ rates Pomona 26th and Hopkins 17th. That\u2019s hardly any different.   I can tell you that people constantly turn down Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, U of M, and yes, Harvey Mudd, alongside other distinguished CS programs to come to Pomona. Ask the CS majors at Pomona what other schools they were considering, and you\u2019d be surprised. There is no denying the research powerhouse strength of Johns Hopkins and its name brand, as well as the fact it has a larger, more resourced (not necessarily BETTER- in terms of quality of teaching, undergrad focus, community, etc) department. This is a classic case of small LAC vs. big university, and there are genuine reasons for picking the former without resulting in anything significant to one\u2019s potential outcomes. LinkedIn Career Insights lists the six most similar schools to Pomona as Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford, Brown, Yale, and UChicago. It may not have the same name brand as Hopkins, but at least in the USA, the people who recruit and read applications hold it to high esteem. For graduate school, it has a track record of sending students to distinguished programs. I can\u2019t speak about the Bay, but I have experience with the east coast and found Pomona to be largely recognized. The advice about connecting with students and alumni directly is good, though. It would be good to get some perspective from undergrads at either schools to better understand the strength and weaknesses of each program, as well as alumni about how their school prepared them.  ```\n"
