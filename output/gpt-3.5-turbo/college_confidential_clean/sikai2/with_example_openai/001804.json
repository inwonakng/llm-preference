So their value (as they vest over time) is zero unless the stock price increases\u201d Fischer Black and Myron Scholes and the Nobel Prize Committee beg to differ. \"\"if the equity compensation was in restricted stock units that vest over time, then it seems unlikely that an already-publicly-traded company would offer $200,000 of such to an entry-level employee for the first job out of (any) college, \"\" The student received 5 offers, all from the usual suspects including 3 of the big 5. 2 of the student\u2019s offers (including one from a big 5) included equity of that magnitude. \u201cbarring something extremely exceptional that is unlikely to be college-dependent.\u201d Yes, this student is exceptional, but there are many exceptional students. This student lacks that one big thing you can point at, so no Olympic medal or Rhodes Scholarship, for example. Is the outcome college dependent? I don\u2019t know. Every talented kid is a bit different. What they need to thrive is different. We never really know about the road not taken. Again, I would choose Michigan based on the information presented. It is a great school. My point is simply that for certain particular exceptional students, who see MIT as a better fit, I can imagine a situation where MIT could be worth it if it. I have no reason to believe that is true for the OP of this thread though.  ```\n"
