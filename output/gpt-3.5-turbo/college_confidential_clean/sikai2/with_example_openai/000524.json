That\u2019s quite long ago, and much has changed at the school since then with respect to substance use awareness and education. As parents of current Kenyon students, @2manycollegequestions4me and I have seen our daughters have great social experiences while taking advantage of many extracurricular opportunities that do not involve alcohol. Drinking related tragedies happen every year on college campuses. Do we paint Penn State, Clemson, Lafayette, Middlebury, Boston University, University of Chicago and UC San Diego all with the same broad stroke, and without consideration of circumstances and statistics? All of these schools have had students die in alcohol related incidents since the 2005 death at Kenyon. Note also, they are not all LACs in rural locations. Again, any student death is a tragic occurrence. However, I think we need to keep the Kenyon incident in perspective.  ```\n"
