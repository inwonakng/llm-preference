From this reader\u2019s perspective: You seek the school with the least rigorous coursework, graded in the most student-friendly manner, and with highest acceptance rates at medical schools. Is that an accurate summary? Extending that: how successful would such an over-promoted and undereducated student be on the MCATs, at medical school, or as a doctor? Would you trust your child\u2019s health to such a doctor? Just a thought experiment. I\u2019d think the strategic goal of your education would include best preparing you to take on the profession you are considering. If you know the type of medical work you want to do, that may help guide your decision based on the specific opportunities provided at different schools. That\u2019s a far better approach. Nobody asks their oncologist for their sophomore grades, they ask them for answers.  ```\n"
