It will improve your odds for a top professional school, no matter how your interests evolve. Harvard and Stanford have the strongest combination of undergrad, plus grad schools in law, business, medicine, engineering, and education. Universities in the second most influential group are Columbia, Penn, and Yale. (And Chicago, if you ignore the lack of an engineering program). The third group is Duke, Northwestern, Cornell, Michigan, and Berkeley (but has no medical school). There are also a few influential but less broad schools: MIT, Cal Tech, and JHU. These few schools control an outsized percentage of the top undergrad and grad school programs. Unsurprisingly, they tend to admit more of their own students to their grad programs (how could they explain to the Trustees that their own undergrads received a relatively poor education?) They also admit more students from the other schools in the group (because no one benefits from an admissions war.) In the end, you can get into a top program from any school, but your odds are a bit better if you begin from inside the group.  ```\n"
