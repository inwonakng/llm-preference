As great as Duke is I really don\u2019t think a lot of Midwestern kids would prefer Duke over x great Midwestern school for engineering. Maybe for other disciplines but not engineering. My kid went to the number school in our state that feeds Northwestern, University of Chicago and of course Illinois/Champaign. Duke might have a few applications with acceptances but again not for engineering. I am sure more East coast /west are applying to Duke.  ```\n"
