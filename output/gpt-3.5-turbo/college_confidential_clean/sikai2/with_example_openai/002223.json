Many students may have the academics to get into Stanford as a student but not the athletic excellence to be admitted as an athlete. [/quote]  This is true in general, but the OP is a male rower.  I walked on to the men\u2019s rowing team at Stanford without any previous experience.  It\u2019s one of the only non-club sports at Stanford where such walk-ons are common.   And as such, while Stanford men\u2019s rowing is an excellent team, I think Princeton\u2019s men\u2019s team typically has more success in national events.  ```\n"
