Wa-hoo-wa!!!\u201d You need to maybe stop with parchment and usnews (and other) rankings and maybe give better advice than look at the rankings for your decision.  In this case that would be a disservice, a serious one,  A CS major will be a fish out of water at Columbia but will be right at home at Michigan, access to labs, research, a technology culture that\u2019s not reflected in rankings.  ```\n"
