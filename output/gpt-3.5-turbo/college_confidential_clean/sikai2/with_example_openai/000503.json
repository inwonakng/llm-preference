Binge drinking is a pervasive problem at many schools. Some schools have banned hard alcohol on campus as a result of these findings, i.e., Dartmouth. Regarding Kenyon (or any school) the best source (but not perfect) for campus drinking, drug, and rape statistics is the Clery report. All schools have to report these numbers annually. In Kenyon\u2019s case when you calculate average drinking and drug infraction incidence (taking into account size of student body) over last 3 years, Kenyon\u2019s incidence is high relative to many schools of similar size like Hamilton, Bowdoin and Williams. Again, these stats are not perfect and can reflect school by school reporting differences, or even how actively campus police/RAs, etc,  are looking for drugs/alcohol, but it is decent data nonetheless.  ```\n"
