Not even considering the full ride.  And their amount of alumni giving is mentioned in the press as astronomical compared to other schools So if I was a football star and was offered a full ride I should say no and play football for Harvard or Stanford and pay them 73k a year after taxes for the privilege of doing so.  Just so I could impress my boss neighbor or someone at s cocktail party If it were revenue neutral I would pick h or s of course.  But this whole conversation is silly. He is smart enough to get s full ride and into h and s. He is smart enough to finish top of his class at usc and go to hbs or hms or Stanford law. And can you think of a more pleasant climate  ```\n"
