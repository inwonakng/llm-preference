Both are great options\u2026academics, prestige. Having said that, you\u2019re right on with respect to this\u2026\u201cRowing, in winter, is not particularly pleasant as it\u2019s long months of indoor training which I would find at Princeton. At Stanford, we can be on the water all year round (sun!).\u201d.  If you spent most of your life rowing on the west-coast, it is a big adjustment to go east-coast (weather wise). Much bigger than wanting to experience another part of the country.  ```\n"
