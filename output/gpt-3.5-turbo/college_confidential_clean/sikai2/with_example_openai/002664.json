One suggestion\u2026 don\u2019t get too carried away by the names of big/attractive employers that visit these campuses\u2026 jobs, internships/co-ops and research opportunities are plentiful. My D2 is a Junior now at GTech. Before she left for her first semester there I gave her one piece of advice/encouragement\u2026 enjoy college life and do well! It is not only a question of learning and preparing for the next stage of life but also making your best friends and savoring whatever your college has to offer beyond academic life. She has more than thrived at GTech and I am proud to say that she is ready for bigger challenges. Go Yellowjackets!  ```\n"
