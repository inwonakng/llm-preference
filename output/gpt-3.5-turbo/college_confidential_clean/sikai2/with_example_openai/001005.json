OP. Everyone has their own view on things but this is only personal opinion. There are many doctors researchers professors and other really smart and successful grads that come out of USC. If someone preferred to go to Stanford it\u2019s understandable. But a candidate from USC could easily be in the same PhD program post grad with them and would be very intellectual indeed. Will there be kids at USC that didn\u2019t have the stats to get into hyps or even Chicago. Sure. But they might be just as smart and turn it on in college or they aren\u2019t but they work hard and e d up starting the next Twitter.  Who knows. But a blanket statement that usc kids not being intellectual is just silly imho.  ```\n"
