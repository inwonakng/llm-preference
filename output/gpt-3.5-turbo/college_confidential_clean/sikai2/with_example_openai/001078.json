During the first quarter, there were no shortage of conversations that, while perhaps not at the level of Plato\u2019s Dialogues, certainly concerned themselves with Plato\u2019s Dialogues. Discussions spilled out of the classroom and into the dining hall and later into the lounge. They\u2019ve since moved well past Plato and Aristotle and more recent discussions are about Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Marx and W. E. B. Du Bois. There are no right or wrong answers to the choice between taking a full-tuition scholarship at USC versus being full pay at Stanford, and it is completely dependent upon a variety of other factors involving all aspects of fit \u2013 academic, social, intellectual, and economic.  ```\n"
