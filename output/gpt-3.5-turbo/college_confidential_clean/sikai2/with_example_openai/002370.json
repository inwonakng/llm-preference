Otherwise both schools are a reach for just about anyone. Of course, once he\u2019s admmitted and given the swimming thing a fair effort (say, for one year) he could quit. I would just advise the OP that a promise of support from Coach Nichols at Amherst is worth a heck of a lot more than a promise of support at HM. As you point out, Nichols gets his guys admitted. HM and the other Claremont McKenna colleges have a reputation for over-promising to prospective athletes on occasion \u2014 the process of athletic support has been in place much longer and is more established in the NESCAC. And, of the five schools in the consortium, Harvey Mudd is the one LEAST interested in sports and in supporting athletes at admission. If you were truly driven to study Engineering, then I\u2019d encourage you to assume a bit more risk and apply ED to Harvey Mudd. But given your ambivalence, I think you have to factor in the difference in coach support between the two schools (and more generally between the NESCACs and the five colleges of the consortium) and go with the bird-in-the-hand, Amherst. I\u2019d hate to see you lose the nearly certain ED admission at Amherst and then fail to secure admission at HM. After the ED round, you\u2019d be SOL at Amherst. Coach support in the NESCAC works only in the ED round. If you do decide to apply ED at HM, I\u2019d encourage you to line up support for EDII. Middlebury could help you there. And you\u2019d really like Coach Rueppel. Good luck! p.s. You might also grow your short list to include Pomona, CMC, Williams, and Swarthmore.  ```\n"
