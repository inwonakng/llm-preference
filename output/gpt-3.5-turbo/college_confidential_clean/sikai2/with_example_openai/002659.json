I would not rule out Olin due to job opportunities, especially if the student wants to eventually wants to settle in Boston (like my son did) or in Silicon Valley. For the skimmers, I\u2019ll add employer info from one of my links (similar to what I did for grad schools\u2026 but this time there is a heading so I know for sure the timeframe:  2006/first class thru 2016, fewer than  1000 grads) OLIN - TOP EMPLOYERS Google  31 Microsoft 30 athenahealth 24 Apple 11 Blue Origin 7 Ivani 7 Navy 7 Pivotal 7 Amazon 6 Raytheon 6 Rockwell Automation 6 Boeing 5 HubSpot 5 Synapse 5 Note - A few students have created their own start-ups.  My son had friends with a start-up that received $3 million in Venture Capital funding when they were  age 21 . TOP SUMMER INTERN EMPLOYERS Apple athenahealth Barrett Technology Bose GE Google IBM Ivani Microsoft OnShape Pivotal Raytheon Tesla Top Summer Research Labs Caltech Harvard University Johns Hopkins University MIT Olin Of course  the above info is NOT reason for a student to pick Olin if it is not the right fit.  I only posted it  to give future readers confidence that it is possible for a new/teeny school to have an excellent reputation with employers and grad schools (even if, gasp\u2026 it us undergrad-only, with limited research opportunity)  ```\n"
