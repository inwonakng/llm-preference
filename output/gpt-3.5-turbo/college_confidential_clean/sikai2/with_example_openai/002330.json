That\u2019s not as straightforward a comparison as UM and Columbia, where UM has the clear edge. Cornell and Penn have the two best engr/cs programs in the ivies and would be in the second set of schools I mentioned. I have actually met grads from those schools out here.\u201d I agree that Columbia may not be comparable to Cornell and Penn. I thought that was a reasonable comparison, but that makes sense. @theloniusmonk \u201cSecond, you have stock options that will lower the starting salary in companies, esp in tech. Grads will take a lower salary if it means 500 Google stock vesting over 4 years.\u201d That is definitely true. This year is the first time I have seen a 21 year old undergrad with a CS offer of $100k+ salary and another $100k+ in onboarding (signing bonus + relocation + stock/options). The talented CS kids seem to be really cleaning up this year. Are you seeing that more broadly?  ```\n"
