The state share of costs per student dropped from $14,690 in 1996 to $7,160 in 2017, according to UC data. The university has made up some of the difference by hiking tuition and increasing the number of out-of-state students, who pay more, but both efforts have sparked opposition.\u201d http://www.dailycal.org/2015/11/23/to-fund-enrollment-boost-uc-will-phase-out-out-of-state-financial-aid/ Along with the elimination of financial aid for incoming out-of-state students, the university is increasing nonresident tuition by 8 percent in the next year and projecting to enroll an additional 1,200 nonresident undergraduates. Out-of-state students make up a significant portion of students on the university\u2019s flagship campus \u2014 roughly 35 percent of UC Berkeley\u2019s incoming students were nonresidents in 2014. Abril raised concerns about the effects of cutting out-of-state financial aid on campus diversity. \u201cYou\u2019ll be creating a pipeline for that percentage of students to be entirely socioeconomically homogeneous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll lose most of the students who would ever consider coming here who are low income and out of state.\u201d http://www.dailycal.org/2018/02/02/cautious-optimism-campus-budget-update-reveals-progress-deficit-dearth-state-funding/  ```\n"
