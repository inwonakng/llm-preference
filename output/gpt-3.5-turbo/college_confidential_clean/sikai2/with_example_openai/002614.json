For Yale quite a few people also choose Penn simply for engineering, in addition to Wharton and dual degrees.  As for M&T cross admits routinely choose Penn over Yale. (M&T people who turn down Penn most often go to Stanford, MIT and even less so Harvard, it is practically never  Yale).  The cross-admit split of Penn vs Yale is not as clear a minority as that of Harvard/Stanford vs Penn. Regarding my so-called assertions, do you dispute that Penn has a stronger engineering school than Yale? (open any ranking out there, research funding stats etc).  Or that there are more engineering offerings and STEM-oriented student clubs/organizations at Penn? Or do you dispute that Penn is more pre-professionally and practically minded than Yale? Penn has about 37 engineering student organizations, Yale has about 17. Penn organizes the biggest college hackathon in the world, PennApps. Yale offers 3 ABET-accredited BSE engineering degrees, Penn offers 10. But as I said above quite a few times, fit is even more important than all else and I have repeatedly urged @sheilsarda to consider fit and the differences of culture between the schools.  ```\n"
