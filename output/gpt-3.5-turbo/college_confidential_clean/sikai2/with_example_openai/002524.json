I don\u2019t know OP at all. I was just asking OP to decide for himself whether or not he feels that he wants the challenge. To some extent every student has to decide this for himself or herself. \u201cMcGill will have some very bright people and very challenging classes. It also will (at least early on) have gigantic lectures\u201d During a tour I sat in the largest lecture hall at McGill. I did not count the seats, but as far as I could tell it is the same size as the largest lecture hall at MIT, the room where I studied freshman physics. (Okay, I checked, the largest lecture hall at McGill seats 600, the largest at MIT seats 566). \u201cIt depends what the OP is looking for.\u201d I agree.  ```\n"
