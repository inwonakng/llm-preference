It\u2019s difficult to get a sense of what you want.  You say you want to study finance. Haverford doesn't offer finance.  You say you want to also study creative writing/English/history. Both colleges offer that and you can study both finance and creative writing at Richmond. You say you don't like science but seem concerned about the number of science courses offered by each college. Both schools offer a myriad of natural science electives. Both colleges offer a study abroad program at the London School of Economics.   I don\u2019t have a horse in this race so I\u2019m not trying to persuade you one way or the other. It took me just a few minutes to search for these answers on each college\u2019s respective websites. My sense is that you are looking for reasons not to go to Richmond. You\u2019ve received some detailed responses from other posters so I hope that you can feel good about which college you ultimately decide to attend. Good luck!  ```\n"
