I will admit my bias as a Cal alum (too many crew titles to count), but I would strongly recommend Princeton unless you think you want to be a West Coast person after graduating.  Stanford has a definite focus on graduate students versus undergraduates; Princeton does not.  As the father of a Dartmouth grad from California, I\u2019d recommend a change of scenery for your college years.  There\u2019s a lot to learn outside of class.  ```\n"
