She is also interested in STEM and we found Carleton to have one of the strongest programs, among other things. If your son\u2019s goal is to get out of the Midwest, I think discussing your topics is a moot point. Both schools offer equally strong liberals arts education, but they are different in vibe. Another question to ask him though: does he want to live and work on the East Coast right after graduation? If so, Amherst will have more name recognition there than Carleton for recruiting by employers who are clueless about SLACs. On the other hand, Carleton is better known in the Midwest and among friends in our community, here in California (which is the second biggest supplier of Carls after Minnesota). But in the end, both schools have strong reputations and alumni networks, and both are highly regarded by grad schools, if that is your son\u2019s goal. And among employers who know SLACs, both will have equal standing. Responses to your topics, PART 1:  [quote] He plans to study Physics (and go on to grad school). The strength of the Physics department/program is one of the primary considerations. My impression is that Carleton\u2019s Physics program is stronger than Amherst\u2019s. [/quote]  My friends who are physics faculty at top universities (including a college roommate who is a physics professor at Stanford) seem to think Carleton has one of the strongest programs while Amherst is known more for its strength in the humanities & social sciences. This is reflected in the breakdown of students by major too. However, Amherst is an amazing school and I\u2019m sure your son will get a great science education in either school. Incidentally, physics is one of my D\u2019s interests. BTW, did your son get a nice letter from the Carleton physics department chair, Prof. Pattanayak? If he listed Physics as an interest on Common App, he should have.  [quote] The general campus atmosphere: My son prefers an open, collaborative, diverse, somewhat laid-back environment. [/quote]  Amherst is more diverse ethnically. They have recently made a push to recruit URMs, and the very fact that the college president\u2019s quote on diversity was a topic for the Common App writing supplement speaks volumes about their priorities. Carleton is 60% White. However, Carleton tries hard to make their student body as diverse as possible, given that Minnesota doesn\u2019t attract as many minority students, and they love international students. Moreover, our impression is that the students are very respectful of other cultures, open-minded about diverse ideas and customs, and welcoming of diverse students. (We are Asian American.) Diversity can also refer to interests and personalities, and Carleton is definitely diverse in that sense. My wife and daughter attended the International Festival last Saturday while visiting Carleton and saw evidence of this. Plus, they explicitly asked minority students whether they felt uncomfortable there. Except for one African American male, most said that they never felt excluded or uncomfortable. One African American male from L.A. went so far as to say that he has never worried about being profiled or harassed by cops in the Twin Cities or Northfield, which is a far cry from his lifelong experience in diverse Southern California. (St. Olaf, however, is a different story. Read the news to learn what\u2019s happening there. But right-minded students are standing up against hate and protesting against the administration, which has apparently done nothing to combat the racist acts.) Our takeaway from visits and conversations was that Carleton is one of the friendliest, most supportive, and most collaborative colleges out there. And while the academics are intense, they are pretty laid back, or at least they don\u2019t overtly give off a competitive vibe. Amherst seemed more \u201cclassic New England competitive\u201d to us, and students didn\u2019t appear as happy on the surface, but I don\u2019t want to generalize based on our experience at one point in time. You\u2019ll find all kinds of students at both schools, and I\u2019m sure your son will find a core group of friends who will make his college years a positive experience. Faculty at both schools are great.  [quote] The kind of students who go there: To give an idea, one thing he really liked about Carleton, in a survey asking students what word they\u2019d use to describe students there, \u201cquirky\u201d was the top choice (at another school, it was \u201chipster\u201d, which he didn\u2019t care for). [/quote]  PSA: Some past and present Carls are requesting that people get over the \u201cquirky\u201d label.  However, it is true that students at Carleton come from colorful backgrounds, which makes life more interesting. I can tell you that we found the students (and other college community members) to be the friendliest and most down-to-earth of the 30+ colleges we visited. EVERYONE would stop and talk at length about everything we wanted to know, and if they were rushing to class, they would offer to drag my daughter along with them to class, introduce her to professors, and treat her to coffee and lunch afterwards. How cool is that? This is precisely why she fell in love with that place. Our tour guide at Amherst was friendly, but aren\u2019t all of them expected to be? The average student we intercepted to chat seemed to be in a hurry to get away, no matter the time of day. Not a reason to judge an entire school, but we couldn\u2019t help coming away with certain perceptions of the campus culture.  ```\n"
