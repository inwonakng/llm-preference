I don\u2019t mean to hijack the conversation, but may I ask, if you know, what the financial aid situation is like when a student does the 3-2 program?  Is the tuition and financial aid decision made at the engineering school, or is it Hamilton rates and financial aid for the whole 5 years?  I ask because I believe my son would be eligible for much more aid at one of the schools in the program, but I would like to see him get the writing/communications enrichment that Hamilton offers.  Unfortunately, though, I think Hamilton is going to be unaffordable for us - definitely would be at 5 years.  ```\n"
