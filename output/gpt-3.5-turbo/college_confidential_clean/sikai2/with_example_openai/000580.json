Cornell is well known to be a bit of meat grinder for kids in premed. Not sure about engineering. Rensselaer is a preeminent school. VT is also elite in the global picture. Cornell is great but it doesn\u2019t automatically lead to a life of leisure and riches or guaranteed happiness. If so your hubby would write s check for all four years and be done with it. It\u2019s a long life and being happy is more important in the end than anything. Any of these schools offer your d a great chance at all that is good in life and a great engineering job if that what she wants. Tell him to let her grow and be independent. It\u2019s our first job as parents.  ```\n"
