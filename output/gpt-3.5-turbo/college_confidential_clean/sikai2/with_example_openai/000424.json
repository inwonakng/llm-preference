The post was unclear as to whether this referred to the MBA program, the undergraduate business program or both. Probably both. Kelley has offers some innovative, cutting edge & high demand specialties. Nevertheless, I understand the charm of the South & the lure of Atlanta & Athens. But, direct admission to a high quality undergraduate business program is valuable, as is admission to the honors college. P.S. Which school or program starts first ? Helpful to begin early so that you forget thinking about the choice & just focus on your new home. It may help to see the housing options available to you at each school.  ```\n"
