But the students are very smart and can handle it.  At orientation, the school stresses how hard it will be, and also stresses how none of you would be here if we didn\u2019t know you can handle it.  But your point is true.  Many hold after school jobs, and nearly everyone participates in clubs and other activities, on top of seemingly endless hours of studying.  And they\u2019re all better for it.  They very quickly learn time management, and naturally push themselves to excel at everything they do, as they\u2019ve been doing their whole lives.  Employers know this.  When they hire GT grads, they\u2019re getting someone very used to high workload and high performance.  This is true of many engineers, but especially prevalent at GT. BTW, as example, my son works for a basketball analytics startup, is VP of the sports business club, plays for GT club volleyball, practices with women\u2019s varsity, plays intramurals, goes to every basketball and football game, watches plenty of sports on TV, is active in fraternity with plenty of partying, and still finds time for all that studying.  His schedule amazes me, and he\u2019s pretty much like everyone else there.  ```\n"
