I personally think this is a ridiculous thing to do.  Your parents might be willing to offer it to you, but parents are willing to do all kinds of self-destructive things for their children.  At some point, it is up to the kids to look out for their parents.   You have nearly enough money saved in college savings account to pay for MIT.  If you choose it over the full ride, you should commit to providing the rest on your own and not further burdening your parents.  They have already done their part.  They saved up an enormous sum for your education.  Be grateful and give them a break.  ```\n"
