It\u2019s all in the company you keep. Also, some years ago, Rochester established a forward-looking policy where they offer a fifth year tuition-free if a student has earned a degree in a focused major (such as engineering) in four years, and wants a chance to broaden his or her education with the electives that couldn\u2019t fit into the schedule. However, their school ranking took a hit by organizations that look at the percentage of students who graduate in four years. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s still the case. Upshot: numbers aren\u2019t everything.  ```\n"
