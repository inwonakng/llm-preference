Some have referenced the USC scholarship as a golden ticket, but those other admission offers must feel like golden tickets too. Walking away from the Ivy offers of admission is going to be understandably hard. We are in a somewhat similar situation where the first choice school was very clear when costs were equal, but a last minute full academic scholarship at #2 makes the choice more difficult.  In our case, the cost differential is much smaller (maybe about 60-70k) but once you \u201csee\u201d that cost savings it is very hard to \u201cunsee\u201d it.   Best of luck with the decision.  ```\n"
