It sounds like you aren\u2019t dwelling on rep, which is good \u2013 I just wanted to throw that out there for anyone else reading, who does care. They are so different that if you figure out your main preferences \u2013 things most important to you \u2013 you\u2019ll pick the place that presents the better fit. Key differences \u2013 bear in mind that some of these are typical in a U vs. LAC matchup and should not be thought to reflect poorly on Hopkins or Pomona per se:  Pomona will have smaller classes, especially in survey-level courses, and easier access to profs. JHU offers more majors and classes (compare Pomona's class offerings to see how they compare in terms of breadth -- I'll assume both schools offer the majors you listed above...) JHU has some D1 sports and far more research opportunities... but also far more competition for coveted research spots. (JHU does have the #1 research budget in the US, a plus if that might interest you; but available research at Pomona, meager as it is by comparison, is far more likely to go to undergrads).  Hopkins has an urban setting, while Pomona is more small town/suburban. Weather: four seasons vs. the southern california season. Hopkins does have a rep for competitiveness, but that is bound to be the case wherever pre-med is so popular. Pomona, by virtue of its less pre-professional vibe (typical of LAC vs. U...), is bound to be less competitive overall. But that doesn't mean the kids majoring in whatever you choose will be more or less competitive at either school.  These are just some of the things you might consider. I would put academic fit first: majors, classes, distribution requirements/curricular style, class sizes, overall vibe if you can get a handle on it, etc. After that, think about the environment/setting and social vibe, dorms, etc.  ```\n"
