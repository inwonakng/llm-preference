But I was a Journalism major at UW, and I thought it was hard. I wrote a whole mess of research papers (one 12-pager was written twice, when my floppy disk somehow didn\u2019t save it properly the first time\u2026 oh joy), about two-thirds of my non-STEM exams were essay- or case-based and the multiple choice exams were A-J/K/L rather than A-D. Granted, I had an active social life, and I could have worked harder, but I had a hard time earning A\u2019s there. UW does not seem interested in handing out A\u2019s that aren\u2019t earned. I was a 3.8, single-sitting uncoached 30 kid from northern Wisconsin, and for the first time in my life, I couldn\u2019t coast. A lot of kids simply can\u2019t handle the academics or the academics/social balance, but it isn\u2019t a cakewalk for the other 67ish% who can. That said, kids can become distracted at Yale too, and I would imagine if one were to not give great effort, it would show in his or her GPA. Yale is a proud school \u2013 they care about their grad rate, but they also care about their academic rep. I have a dog in this race, but if everything else were even or nearly so, I would suggest Yale. But it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s six-figures not, and this kid wants to go to med school. OP, UW is a blast. Paying $5k per annum vs. $70k at Yale makes it, to me, the better choice given your circumstances.  ```\n"
