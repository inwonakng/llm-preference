[/quote]  . Wrong. If this were true, then UCLA or UCSD would be more rigorous than MIT and Berkeley! Stanford doesn\u2019t cram semester long 15 week courses into 10 week stress filled classes. Typical 3 or 2 class sequence such as intro math (51/52/53) is equivalent to a two semester sequence at Berkeley or MIT. For non sequence classes, the material covered at Stanford is much less than the equivalent one at MIT/Berkeley.  ```\n"
