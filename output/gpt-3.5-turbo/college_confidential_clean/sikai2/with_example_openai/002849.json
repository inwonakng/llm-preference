Michigan is basically Penn, but bigger, with a better student spirit, and not as much prestige\u2013albeit still a great school. Michigan and Penn also have a major called PPE, which combines philosophy, economics, and political science in one major. Since your son is interested in both law and business, this major may interest your son. I applied ED to Penn also, as a PPE major, and got rejected. Also, I think Michigan is easier to get to than UVA. Michigan is just a flight into Detroit and then like a 40 minute car ride. Charlottesville is in the middle of nowhere, and it may be harder to get to.  ```\n"
