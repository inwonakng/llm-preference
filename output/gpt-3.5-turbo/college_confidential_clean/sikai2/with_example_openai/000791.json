FANG is a term coined by Jim Cramer to refer to the best performing public tech stocks (aka Facebook, amazon, Netflix, google).  These are frequently offhandedly seen as the most desirable public tech firms to work for save for Amazon probably.  Collectively this acronym has taken on a respect equivalency to MBB for consulting, M7 for MBA or T14 for law schools.  You can probably expand FANG to include Airbnb, Uber, Snapchat, Apple as other desirable tech firms as well.  ```\n"
