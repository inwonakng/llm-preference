Both universities are very well rounded, but Michigan just happens to be more well-rounded academically (top undergraduate programs in Architecture, Business, Music, Nursing etc\u2026). In Duke\u2019s favor, it is indeed more selective, and its endowment per student is larger. In all cases, the relative advantage that these universities have over each other are negligible. They are both equally exceptional. \u201c4. Duke has a lower acceptance rate, but the quality of the student bodies is similar\u201d Is there any evidence, other than personal experience, for such claim given that it is used to refute a number?\"\" Sadly, no. I can only speak from experience. In-state students at Michigan have lower tests scores than OOS students, but in the classroom, they perform just as well. The in-state students I knew, and I confess to have only know a few dozen, never prepared for standardized tests. This was strange to me because like most OOS students, I worked hard on my SAT preparation. That is why I said that there is a fundamental difference in paradigm to consider when comparing test scores at public universities and private universities. As it is, I am not sure if anybody can differentiate between a student body that graduated from high school with a 3.9 unweighted GPA and an average SAT/ACT of 1410/31.5 and a student body that graduated from high school with a 3.9 unweighted GPA having taken similar classes, and an average SAT/ACT of 1480/33. But when you factor in the effort, or lack thereof, that in-state students at top public universities put into their standardized test preparation, the gap in test scores is likely even smaller.  ```\n"
