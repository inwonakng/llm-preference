[/quote]  @JenniferClint : I think you needed to know that most, if not all, engineering students at Cal are not as gaga as Duke students are about winning Rhodes. What they care more about is how to become the next Elon Musk or how to become a successful startup founder, if not to work for those giant tech companies in the Bay Area and make six-figure salary (excluding bonus) as just entrants. That doesn\u2019t make Berkeley engineering inferior to Duke simply because the school doesn\u2019t have the same culture as Duke\u2019s. And, btw, what is Oxford engineering compared to Berkeley\u2019s!  ```\n"
