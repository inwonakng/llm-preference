Those rankings include the average SAT scores for the undergraduate business students. I was somewhat surprised by the most recent P&Q undergraduate business school ratings & rankings released on December 12, 2018 (one month ago). IU-Kelley was ranked #22 with average SAT scores of 1437, and 68% of the undergraduate business students were in the top 10% of their high school class. UGA-Terry is ranked #36 with average SAT scores of only 1300 (which supports another poster\u2019s assertion that entry into UGA-Terry is easy) & that less than 66% were in the top 10% of their high school class.  ```\n"
