The strength of the Physics department/program is one of the primary considerations. My impression is that Carleton\u2019s Physics program is stronger than Amherst\u2019s. [/quote]  Carleton is commonly regarded as one of the more STEM-oriented LACs, while Amherst is sometimes regarded as less STEM-focused. You can determine the percentage of STEM majors at a LAC by adding up the relevant numbers (for computer science, engineering if offered, biology, math, and physical sciences) in Section J of the Common Data Set. For these two schools, I get: Carleton: 40.2 % STEM, 12.1 % physical sciences specifically Amherst: 26.6 % STEM, 5.1 % physical sciences specifically So there does appear to be more interest in STEM, and in physical sciences particularly, at Carleton. There is some suspicion that \u201copen curriculum\u201d schools (such as Amherst) attract a disproportionate number of science/math-phobes (because they can avoid taking any classes in these fields). In recent years, there has some concern about the aging of the Amherst science facilities, but a brand new science center is under construction, and is scheduled to open in Fall 2018. I\u2019m sure you can get a great undergraduate physics education at Amherst. However, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there are more physics faculty and a broader variety of physics courses at Carleton. You could review the college catalogs to see. Note, however, that Amherst students also have access to the 5-College Consortium, which could increase the range of physics course options, most likely at UMass.  ```\n"
