With the exception that only looking at Harvard medical school as the analysis of who gets in doesn\u2019t represent even 3 percent of the medical school population.  If Harvard medical school is the end game then it is, of course, relevant. But that is not the practical application of your post. It is not reslistic for a Harvard undergrad to plan on Harvard medical school. In terms of sheer numbers I believe a school like university of Florida has the second most medical school admits in 2017. A big part is the size of the population. It may be for a pragmatic kid with h stats is to go to uf for free. Kill it and nail mcat. Then be assured of  med school and perhaps h, but the best chance of zero debt for both. And great matches come from a lot of schools post med school  ```\n"
