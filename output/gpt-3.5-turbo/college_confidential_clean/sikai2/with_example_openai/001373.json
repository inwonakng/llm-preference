Suffice it to say that a STEM major is going to have pretty much the same opportunities and drawbacks at any of the top 100 colleges or universities; grades and standardized tests are how you will  distinguish yourself from the pack - not the college\u2019s pedigree. If you major in Bio or Chem you are probably going to have to go on to graduate school of some sort to make a decent living. Computer Science is still a very hot major and you can find a job as a programmer right out of the box. The same is true for Engineering except that a B.S degree by itself hits a salary wall about six years after graduation (at which point, a lot of Humanities and Social Science majors start catching up) and you will want to pursue at least a Masters. IMO, Physics and Math are still the sweet spot as far as intellectual exploration and practical applications are concerned. Physics and Math majors have been known to land on Wall Street in various capacities.  ```\n"
