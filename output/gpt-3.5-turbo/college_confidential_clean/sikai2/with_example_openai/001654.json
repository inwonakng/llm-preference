He is taking industrial engineering since its more business focus with a business minor. He and 3 friends started a tech club and won 2 grants one for $5,000 and 1for $10,000. He is coming back next week for a week capstone https://lsa.umich.edu/bli/bli-fellows/capstone-experience11 They already won https://www.optimizemi.org/#turn-ideas-into-impact. All of this has lead to a university of Michigan alumni reaching out to them to be part of this fast growing sector. He was put on an advisory panel for one of the largest seed companies in the start up world. Again through Michigan alumni. He is just ending his freshman year. Someone said it Nicely. At Michigan you can be whatever you want to be. Good Luck.  ```\n"
