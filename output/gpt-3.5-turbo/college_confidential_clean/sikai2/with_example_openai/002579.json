[/quote]  I\u2019m sure that this is true. However, I also think that there are significantly more \u201cscience-phobes\u201d and \u201cmath-phobes\u201d out there than \u201csocial science-phobes\u201d or \u201chumanities-phobes\u201d. Amherst\u2019s own data bear this out. The following numbers are from the Amherst Class of 2011, and were compiled for a 2013 accreditation review. For comparison, let\u2019s use \u201c3+ classes per academic division\u201d as a benchmark, because it is a common LAC distribution requirement (as at, for example, Williams): Humanities Division: 8% did not meet the benchmark (i.e. took fewer than 3 classes in this division). 1% took zero classes. Social & Behavioral Sciences Division: 10% did not meet the benchmark. 2% took zero classes. Science & Math: 43% did not meet the benchmark. 14% took zero classes. It\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that many Amherst students use the open curriculum as a way to avoid science and math. Yes, some avoid humanities or social sciences, but not nearly as many. Another way to look at it: 92% of the Amherst Class of 2011 would have satisfied commonly used distribution requirements for humanities, and 91% would have done so in social sciences. But only 57% would have done so in science and math. https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/AC_NEASC_5_Year_Report_2013_0.pdf (Table: Class of 2011 Courses Attempted by Division, on p. 52).  ```\n"
