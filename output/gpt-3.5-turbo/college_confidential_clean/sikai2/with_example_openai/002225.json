Looking at the Math sequence clearly shows that. The Single Variable Calc sequence is 3 courses as well as the MV/LA sequence whereas at Semester schools they are 2 Semester courses. [/quote]  You are using the slowest version of the lowest possible math sequence as an example.  Most feshmen did single variable calculus in HS and take  more advanced  math sequences that go at a faster pace.  A partial summary of freshmen math options is below.  Note that there a variety of different options for students with different math background/ability/interests, as well as students who are looking to cover the material more rigorously, rather than offering a single level for all students.  I also wouldn\u2019t assume athletes generally choose the lowest level for everything.  I\u2019d expect you are more likely to find premeds in the lowest versions of courses than athletes. Math 19-21 \u2013 3 quarter version of single variable calculus Math 41-42 \u2013 2 quarter version of single variable calculus Math 51-53 \u2013 differential and integral calculus in several variables, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations Math 61-63M \u2013 covers the material of the Math 50 series at a much more advanced level with an emphasis on rigorous proofs and conceptual arguments Math 61-63DM \u2013  covers the same linear algebra material as the Math 60CM series and otherwise focuses on topics in discrete mathematics, algebra, and probability theory at an advanced level with an emphasis on rigorous proofs I\u2019ve taken classes at a lot of colleges with semester systems including RPI, SUNY, UCSD and UWy.  I found Stanford courses typically to go at a much faster pace, although there was  a significant variation from class to class.  ```\n"
