The cost difference over 4 years is about $184,000 ($46,000 X 4) plus interest. NYU Stern finance is one of the best undergraduate programs in the world. Lots of internship opportunities. Earn a NYU Stern degree, work for two to three years, then get an MBA from Wharton, Columbia, Northwestern, Chicago, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Dartmouth, UCal-Bezerkley or even from Duke, Virginia, Michigan and you will be much better off than just having an undergraduate degree from Wharton. Or get a one year specialty masters degree in finance, data science, etc. if that is your career goal. Do NOT pay sticker price for Wharton when you have a very substantial discount from NYU Stern. If you pay sticker for Wharton in light of your Stern offer, then you should be dismissed from business school, common sense school & anything related. What would you rather have for essentially the same out-of-pocket dollars (unless you get an MBA scholarship which are readily available for female MBA candidates):   A very expensive University of Pennsylvania Wharton undergraduate degree or   An affordable NYU Stern undergraduate degree from one of the best finance schools in the world & a prestigious MBA from a top school based on your career goals after working for 2 or 3 years post undergraduate school ?    ```\n"
