The open curriculum allowed me to follow my career interests while taking advantage of the greatest resource the school has to offer\u2026its teachers. [/quote]  You\u2019re giving the open curriculum too much credit here. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 it\u2019s great that a STEM major takes lots of cool non-STEM classes. This is, in fact, the LAC ideal. But the exact same thing would have been possible at a LAC with distribution requirements, e.g. Carleton or Williams or Swarthmore. The point of distribution requirements is simply to guarantee that a STEM major takes non-STEM classes. So you could have been a STEM major and taken lots of cool non-STEM courses at any of these schools. The only difference is that Amherst allowed you to take cool non-STEM courses on a voluntary basis, while at the other schools, taking cool non-STEM courses would have been required. But the net result (for you) would have been exactly the same. If you plan to explore a wide variety of disciplines during your LAC career, then it makes no difference whether you pick a school with an open curriculum or one with distribution requirements. If there are distribution requirements, you will fulfill them without even trying. The open curriculum matters for people who want to limit their explorations. For example, if you were a STEM major and you wanted to avoid taking non-STEM courses, then it would make a big difference if you enrolled at Amherst vs. the other schools.  ```\n"
