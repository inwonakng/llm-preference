Visited both schools with my daughter and full disclosure am a Vassar grad. My daughter and I found the opposite of what you\u2019re expecting about the students. Vassar students were more down to earth, seemed happy and I would not describe as New York wanna bes. We both found more of a pretentious vibe at Kenyon and not one person looked up or smiled. The folks in admissions, including the student interviewer my daughter met with, were down right rude with a snobby air. Also Kenyon is very isolated so that\u2019s a consideration as well. Poughkeepsie leaves a lot to be desired but the area around campus is nice and NYC is an option although it\u2019s not so close that you\u2019d be heading there every weekend. We saw confederate flags all over the area near Kenyon - a huge turn off for us at least. I know others will have other opinions - maybe we just hit Kenyon on a bad day.  Best of luck.  ```\n"
