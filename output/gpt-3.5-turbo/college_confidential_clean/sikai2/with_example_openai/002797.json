This doesn\u2019t prove anything regarding test scores, since we don\u2019t know what the non-submitters\u2019 scores were or would have been. I think we can fairly say that a higher test score means, per se, that you know more right now than a kid who scores lower than you. It does not, of course, mean that you are smarter or more capable; maybe you\u2019ve just had better teachers or a broader curriculum, or more practice, or the test was more important to you.  ```\n"
