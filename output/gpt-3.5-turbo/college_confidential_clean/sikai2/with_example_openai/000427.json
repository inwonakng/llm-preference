One reason that I was unsure of the cost difference is that some state schools waive non-resident tuition surcharge (meaning a non-resident would just pay in state rates) if awarded a scholarship of any amount, including as little as $500. I cannot recall the state that was well known for this. (Not sure, but I thought it was either Iowa or Indiana. I was familiar with this regarding law school admission.)  ```\n"
