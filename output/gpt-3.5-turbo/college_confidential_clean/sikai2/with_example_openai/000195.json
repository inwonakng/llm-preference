The thing that sticks out about NC State is it\u2019s the only one of these 3 that is close to a significant amount of potential employers. I know that it\u2019s very possible to get intenships & jobs from a more-isolated campus\u2026but when the employers are nearby,  it simplifies a lot of the interviewing, the traveling, the housing (especially for summer internships), etc. Also, I don\u2019t know if internships during the school year are common for engineering students, but if they are, NC State would seem to have a clear advantage over the others.  ```\n"
