MIT 2016 course 6-3 graduates had a median pay of $110,000 out of a range of $66,500 to $175,000, according to https://gecd.mit.edu/sites/default/files/about/files/2016-gss-survey.pdf .\"\" They are not extreme outliers. I\u2019m surprised that you don\u2019t know that. For some reason, the top schools are systematically not telling people how much their students are really being compensated. A graduates salary may be $110,000 say, but then there may be a significant $50k+ signing bonus and another $200k+ in equity that accrues over a few years, and other valuable perks on top of that. The schools are only publishing salaries. The total compensation is often very different than the salary.  ```\n"
