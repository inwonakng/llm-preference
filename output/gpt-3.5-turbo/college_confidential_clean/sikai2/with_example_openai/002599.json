Also specifically the M&T program is a really unique program that opens amazing doors in business and tech. If you see that you are not interested in the Wharton part anymore, then you can get out of M&T and do a dual major in CS and Bioengineering. Unless you rally fit in better at Yale and you cannot see yourself at Penn, I would pick Penn because it is stronger for engineering  and business and also because of the unique strengths of the M&T program. Campus culture and vibe is different between the two schools. Penn has a strong pre-professional element (business,s engineering), it focuses more on the application of knowledge and interdisciplinary education. It also ha a more vibrant social life and is located in a big city but also has a defined camps. Yale is more intellectual, has that old-school classic ivy-league/hogwarts type of vibe, is located in a much smaller city. The most popular major at Yale is history. Also it has a smaller undergrad population than Penn.  ```\n"
