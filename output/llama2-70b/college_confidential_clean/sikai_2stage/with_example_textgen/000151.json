Once you\u2019re in college, aim for good grades - will you still need to work many hours to fund college? I have many students who work far too many hours and are unable to dedicate time to their classes. 20 hours a week is usually the max suggested for work. With your work experience and a decent GPA from Pitt, you can target  decent internships in the summers, I think. My DS1 did not have hot stats to get into a top CS program, but had a lot of self motivated programming experience. He is now a sophomore at a mid-level university and got a summer internship based on decent grades and experience. Also, look into taking some general education credits at your local community college in the summer before starting college\u2026 Many have class schedules that work with students\u2019 work schedules.( Make sure all credits transfer) This could ease the load in the regular semesters if you are working.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
