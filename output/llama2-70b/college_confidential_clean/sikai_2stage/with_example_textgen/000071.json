That score translates to a 35 act.  The middle of your 34 to 36 example. If you add in the 34s maybe another 30k. I\u2019ve checked before but it\u2019s not the exact number that matters. Top ten percent of any group is good company. Top five percent even better.  Top two percent. That\u2019s pretty close to rare. That isn\u2019t one in a million but pretty darn exceptional. There aren\u2019t really \u201cscores\u201d of students in the 34 to 36 cohort as many suggest. Only mentioning this as CC threads are filled with this small group of exceptional students and their parents. It can distort the reality of 2.25 million of the 2.3 million potential applicants.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
