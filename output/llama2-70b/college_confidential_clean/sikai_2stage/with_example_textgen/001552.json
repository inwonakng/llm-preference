Given the huge disparity in total net costs, I think it is an easy decision if the OP is pretty certain of med school and if the prospects of getting into a good med school between Madison and Yale are equivalent, absent OP\u2019s family being so wealthy that the extra quarter million bucks \u00b1 is immaterial to them.  If, however, the prospects of med school are not so certain, the calculus does change somewhat.  Then it is a question of what Madison offers as likely alternatives to Yale in other departments/interests both academically and student life-wise.  Here we have 2 very different institutions.  The OP may thrive in both or one may offer a superior fit vs. the other.  Besides money, we have to consider the value of the experience for 4 very critical years that OP can never get back. I shared a personal anecdote on another similar thread involving Georgia Tech vs Harvard.  My brother chose to go to an honors program of a top public institution.  He ended up at a great med school and then on to residency at one of the top programs in his specialty.  He is very successful and happy.  He wanted to be a doctor from childhood. However, I am only aware of one friend of his from undergrad that he maintains regular contact with. I, on the other hand, had no clue what I wanted to do/be entering college.  I did not decide on a major until junior year.  Going to law school was almost a default.  My closest friends these days though are predominantly my buddies from Yale.  About a dozen of us still take an annual boys\u2019 long weekend trip each year.  They are successful doctors, lawyers, bankers, engineers, business owners and journalists \u2013 I think we have all made each other smarter and better people.
