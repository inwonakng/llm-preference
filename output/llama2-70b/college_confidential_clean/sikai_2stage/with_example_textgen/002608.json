Also there is no toxic environment that discourages friendship and collaboration. Quite the opposite, people are very friendly and actually collaborate with each other a lot and help out each other. Penn students are competitive with themselves, and like to push themselves to achieve more, but they are not competitive/cutthroat against each other. Especially engineering students are highly collaborative. there is the mentality that engineering is tough and we are all in this together and we are all better off helping each other to get through it. The M&T program specifically provides really amazing guidance and mentorship. There is an entire M&T office at Penn dedicated to providing professional and academic guidance only to M&T students and also organizing M&T student and alumni events very often.
