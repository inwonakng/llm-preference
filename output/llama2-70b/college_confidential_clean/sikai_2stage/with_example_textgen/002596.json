It wasn\u2019t enough to dissuade him, but I remember talking about it. For me, it ended up being fantastic in ways I wouldn\u2019t have imagined. When the kids come home early Thanksgiving week, they are home until January. This meant a couple of things \u2026 One, there was no expensive, extra trip home two holidays in a row. You never know what the weather will be like in MN in November. We never had to worry whether those pricey tickets we bought were going to get eaten because he couldn\u2019t get out or back due to weather or that the trip was severely shortened because of delays and such. When he got home for turkey, he was home past New Year\u2019s. Ds2, who is at a faraway school on the semester system, has never come for Thanksgiving. Two, that long break was so welcome. His first two years, he worked for his summer employer. They were thrilled to have him filling 25 hours/week during the busy holiday season. And he loved the extra money.  The third year he got home the week before Christmas because he was abroad. The fourth year he used that extra time to study for the GRE and took it the week before he flew back. Three, people seemed to think that doing study abroad would be difficult because of the trimesters. Well, if you are doing a Carleton program that\u2019s obviously not an issue. And kids, such as my ds, who do a non-Carleton program, just did it in the fall, when it\u2019s an even trade (one trimester/one semester). And, they miss some of that cold weather by not going to campus until spring. Well, \u201cspring.\u201d     ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
