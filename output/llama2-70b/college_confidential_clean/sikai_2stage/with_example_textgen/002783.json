In addition, Bates has a long association with the African-American community, and goes to great lengths to recruit first-gen students. Along with being one of the first test-optional schools, it\u2019s probably fair to say that all those groups were not traditionally associated with high-paying careers. It\u2019s not so much the case now, of course. This is from a NY Times 2015 article, discussing a study on the effect of test scores on GPA: The study \u201cfound no significant difference between nonsubmitters and submitters in graduation rates (0.6 percent lower for nonsubmitters) or cumulative G.P.A. (2.83 for nonsubmitters, 2.88 with test scores).\u201d Furthermore, \u201cData also showed that nonsubmitters are more likely than submitters to be first-generation-to-college enrollees, underrepresented minorities, women, Pell Grant recipients and students with learning differences.\u201d Again, traditionally groups of people that would be expected to earn less. Yet, it\u2019s apparent that educational quality is not suffering. I wasn\u2019t going to make this long, however, I had to look. Bates and Hamilton have both produced 5 Rhodes Scholars. Yet, Bates is #5 in Fulbright Scholars, whereas Hamilton is #15. So it\u2019s pretty clear that Bates is not a sub-par educational institution. It\u2019s also clear that its student body might not typically be from as high-earning a background as Hamilton, which affects endowments, which affects USNWR rankings. Bates has a now-long history of being test-optional, whereas Hamilton does not, though it has modified its test requirements over the years. Re the distribution requirements, that is something my D has found surprising. The requirements are soooo loose. D was given full credit for four of her AP classes. So she has already met some of the requirements, and said to me when choosing her courses for next year, that it feels like there are no requirements. She pretty much is just taking classes she is interested in. At any rate, the whole rankings thing is clearly misleading, and a different thread. A different publication\u2019s ranking will tell a different story. Anyway, OP, good luck with your decision. Either school is a great choice.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
