As awesome as JHU is, it has a rep of being a grind for premeds.  JHU for med or residency.  Not so great for undergrads. Yale is tough on premeds as well.  I\u2019ve told this story before.  When my son was a college freshman premed I ran into an old friend whose son was a freshman premed at Yale.  Her son was determined to go to med school and they were confident Yale would pave the way. The friend was aghast that my son was attending a mid-tier flagship and she voiced a lot of doubt about whether he\u2019d get into a med school.  Fast forward a few years, her son\u2019s GPA was not med-school worthy.  My son will be graduating from med school in May. Don\u2019t believe the hype about Yale inflation and that everyone gets A\u2019s in their classes.  Maybe it\u2019s that way for other paths, but the premed prereqs are still weeder classes at Yale.  Like every other college in the nation, they must reduce the number of their premeds. As for UPitt @ucbalumnus is exactly right.  College is much harder than high school when in a serious major.  Adding premed path into the mix makes things even more difficult.  I have two premed parent forums and every fall parents are posting that their child-who\u2019s-never-received-a-B-in-his-life is now struggling to bring his mid-semester C average in Gen Chem or Bio up to please-be-at-least-a-B.  These are kids who took the most rigorous high school schedules, took the zero period class, and were top 1-5% of their class. I\u2019m a little shocked that the 3.75 GPA req\u2019t is \u201cper semester\u201d and not evaluated at the end of the year.  Bio, chem, and physics classes are usually 4-5 credits per class and a B in one of them can sink a semester\u2019s BCPM GPA even if the student gets A\u2019s in the other BCPM courses he takes that semester. Considering that the Pitt program only takes the cream of the high school crop (poaching from Ivys), and 50% don\u2019t make it thru, there\u2019s reason to be concerned. Of course a Pitt student who gets booted from the program can still proceed as a premed, get GPA where it needs to be and apply to other med schools later.  BUT\u2026the $20k per year EFC may be an issue to the family.  Is it?  [QUOTE=\"\"\"\"] [quote] [quote] ...may still get into a decent med school down the road. [/quote] [/quote] [/QUOTE]  Lol\u2026I can\u2019t let that sentence pass.  We don\u2019t have any \u201cdecent\u201d med schools in the US.  All of our med schools are excellent.  There are about 145 med schools in the USA.  They all teach the same things; the education is flat. Any premed should be thrilled to get into any of them.  No one is too good for any of them. My vote is for Yale. Cost-wise it\u2019s better.  The Yale name will help if his career path changes.  Just remind him NOT to believe the Yale-hype about 90% of students get A\u2019s.  That doesn\u2019t apply to premed prereqs.  He\u2019ll have to be self-disciplined.  Freshman have so many distractions and it\u2019s their first time away from mom and dad. If he gets at least a 3.7 GPA at Yale and scores well on the MCAT (sounds like he\u2019s a strong test taker anyway), and has medically related ECs and some research experiences, he\u2019ll likely get into a med school.  As a Calif resident, he\u2019ll need to apply broadly and include some Midwest privates since getting into a Calif med school is crazy difficult.  [QUOTE=\"\"\"\"] [quote] [quote] His ultimate goal is going medicine. Going with the Pitt's GAP is obviously the way to achieve his goal in one-step shot in a top-10 med school, however, he is looking at about 20k/yr for four under graduate years (he's awarded 20k scholarship but we have to pay the out-state tuition since we are from California), vs Yale offered a total package with only 5k EFC. The other thing bothers my son is that for the GAP you have to maintain a 3.75 for each semester (both overall and BCPM), which means if you miss one, you will be out from the guaranteed medical school admission and end up with a Pitt undergrad education for roughly a cost of 80k in four years, where with Yale you will earn a Ivy undergra education with far less cost and may still get to a decent med school down to the road.
