This isn\u2019t even close, I simply not convincing you af anything even though the facts bear it out. There is no comparison at the undergrad level.\u201d The 6,000 undergraduate students (I am fairly certain it is closer to 8,000 when you include General Studies) still have to share the faculty and resources with those 23,000 graduate students. At any university, undergraduate students do not exist in a vacuum. I don\u2019t see how there\u2019s any difference CU123. Columbia has limited resources, and 31,000 students to look after. Your facts are not convincing at all. A university\u2019s endowment is shared by all of its students, graduate and undergraduate, not just by the undergraduate students. Same with a university\u2019s faculty. If anything, I have provided more facts. Where are the placement figures for Columbia that show that Columbia places more graduates in Silicon Valley? I have shown how many Michigan graduates are placed in major tech firms, and I even provided comparative data from Penn. Sadly, Columbia does not publish such data. Where are the peer ratings that prove that Columbia is a far superior university to Michigan? According to the US News Peer Assessment score, Columbia\u2019s rating hovers between 4.6 and 4.7, while Michigan\u2019s hovers between 4.4 and 4.5. That makes them peers in the eyes of university presidents, deans of undergraduate colleges and provosts. And how do you prove that Columbia has a 6:1 student to faculty ratio when Fu has a 25:1 ratio and the 4,500 College students share their faculty with 3,500 Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences? Those are the facts I want addressed\u2026and they are facts. I am still waiting for the evidence to support your claim that Columbia is a vastly superior university to Michigan to the extent that it is insulting to you that one would even suggest that they are peer institutions.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
