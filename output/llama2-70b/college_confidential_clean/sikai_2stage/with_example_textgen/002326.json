I have no doubt that the best Michigan students can compete with anyone and can command salaries in the $110k - $150k range. However, I suspect that the average and below average Michigan students may not be so competitive and that may bring their average down. To me it appears that there is just not enough information to tell why the Michigan average is lower. Maybe you have some insight? I didn\u2019t see a huge difference in CS (90K for UM, 100K for Penn?) which is the major we\u2019re discussing.  So lot will depend on the respondents as well, Cornell only had 114 respondents (119 responded but five didn\u2019t answer a lot of the questions it looked like) so that\u2019s not a huge response rate.  Maybe those that didn\u2019t have great salaries decided not to report.  Also you\u2019re assuming that everyone is honest in these things. Second, you have stock options that will lower the starting salary in companies, esp in tech.  Grads will take a lower salary if it means 500 Google stock vesting over 4 years.  Also Google I believe sets salary on how well you do in your interview, so once you get an interview, if you\u2019re a SJSU grad (and there are a lot of those at Google and Apple), you can do better wrt compensation than an ivy leaguer if you have a superb interview. And you\u2019re comparing Michigan to Cornell and Penn, who have better engineering and comp sci programs than Columbia.  That\u2019s not as straightforward a comparison as UM and Columbia, where UM has the clear edge.  Cornell and Penn have the two best engr/cs programs in the ivies and would be in the second set of schools I mentioned.  I have actually met grads from those schools out here :-).  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
