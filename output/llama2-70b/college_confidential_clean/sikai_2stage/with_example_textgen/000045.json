All you have to do is to look at the CEOs of top engineering firms to know that your thesis is patently false. Boeing\u2019s current CEO, Dennis Muilenberg went to undergrad at Iowa State. United Launch Alliance\u2026Tony Bruno\u2026Cal Poly. Tim Cook\u2026Apple\u2026Auburn. Larry Page\u2026Alphabet\u2026Michigan. Larry Ellison\u2026Oracle\u2026Illinois (and didn\u2019t graduate). Satya Nadella\u2026Microsoft\u2026first US degree, MS from Wisconsin-Milwaukee. I could go on and on. Sure, you can find some, Jeff Bezos for example, that did go to a \u201ctop\u201d institution, Princeton. Of the top 20 Fortune 500 CEOs though, he\u2019s the only one that hails from the Ivy League. If your story were true all the top spots would be held by grads of \u201ctop\u201d schools. They demonstrably are not. Back to my previous post about JPL\u2019s executive board. Here\u2019s where they were educated: Texas A&M, Sam Houston State, Cal Poly, Cal Poly Pomona, UCLA, Texas, MIT, Colorado, Washington, Toronto, USC and Purdue. Caltech manages JPL, yet there isn\u2019t a single Caltech grad in the top echelon of the organization and only one that hails from a \u201ctop\u201d institution. So, you might not be sure, but I am. Engineering is egalitarian and there\u2019s LOTS of evidence proving it.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
