Yes, my son is a swimmer at Williams and loves it. Of the NESCAC schools we visited, I liked all of them \u2013 Williams, Amherst, Middlebury, and Bowdoin. The coaches were terrific at each school. We really liked Swarthmore, too, and the new coach there, Karin Colby, was terrific. But we shied away from Swarthmore for the same reason you mentioned \u2013 the academic environment seemed a bit intense. Of course, Williams and Amherst are pretty intense, too, but Swarthmore does have a special reputation in that regard. My sense is that Harvey Mudd shares that reputation. It sounds like you\u2019ve gotten the assurances you need at HM \u2013 that your odds of admission are very good. But, as for Engineering, my own personal experience is that there is no undergraduate major more intense. Those who choose that major learn a lot, get a strong degree, and find work. But they don\u2019t have much fun in college. If you\u2019re shying away from Swarthmore because of its academic intensity, then I\u2019d suggest you keep in mind that an Engineering major at HM would be VERY intense \u2013 probably much more than most students at Swarthmore experience. Pre-med at Amherst would be intense but manageable. Of course, I\u2019m just \u201csome guy\u201d with an opinion, but I\u2019d encourage you to give this Engineering some additional thought. I\u2019ve had a dozen or more friends who attempted Engineering in college quickly move on to something else. Even our valedictorian was pulling very low grades at Notre Dame while attempting Engineering \u2013 moved on to something else after the first year and found success. And if you ran into trouble with Engineering at Harvey Mudd, I\u2019m not sure what your other options would be. One last plug \u2013 the NESCAC appears to be a terrific place to swim. And Amherst is a great college town, among the best in the US. If you do apply to Amherst, there\u2019s no harm in reaching out to Rueppel and asking if he would support you for EDII. As for whether to attend a top school for med school, you\u2019ll get lots of opinions here on CC. Some suggest that it doesn\u2019t matter AT ALL where you go \u2013 so long as you have the GPA and the MCAT scores. My sense is that these elite LACs are great places to go pre-med. And if you succeed, you\u2019ll have your pick of top medical schools. And if you don\u2019t succeed \u2013 or simply change your major as a great many do \u2013 you\u2019ll still graduate from one of the top colleges in the country (with a terrific education), and you\u2019ll have wonderful options going forward.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
