It is not accurate to say that GT will necessarily produce the same result, although it could.  You are assuming that going to GT will lead to the same medical school and same cost as Harvard.  I am not assuming anything.  The facts show that Harvard students obtain admission to elite medical schools at a much higher rate.

If you do extraordinarily well, you will get into medical school and maybe get merit money.  Life doesn\u2019t give you pat answers.
