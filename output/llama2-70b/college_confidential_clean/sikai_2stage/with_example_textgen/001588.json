Look at the top NYC private prep schools / New England private prep schools / CA private prep schools like Harvard Westlake where these students largely can choose wherever they want to go and Northwestern will be in the top 10-15 most represented schools. Rice will not be found. Also, look at the top 10-15 feeder schools to the top MBA programs, and you\u2019ll see Northwestern there. Look at Columbia, HBS, Wharton, Stanford, etc. Rice - no where to be found. Also, look at the incoming Investment Banking analyst classes in NY at the top banks - Northwestern will have a few analysts. Rice may have some students at the Houston offices but usually not in NY. Rice is a great school. But, it\u2019s reputation just isn\u2019t that strong on the coats.
