He is wait listed at USC dance and we are looking to put down deposit at Stanford (bio).  He is not a super \u201cintellectual\u201d kid as his friends who got full tuition scholarship at USC or Regents Scholarships from UC\u2019s, but he is one of the kindest and most passionate and hardworking kids I know.
