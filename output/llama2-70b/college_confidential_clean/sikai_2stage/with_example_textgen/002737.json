Ann Arbor is larger so not part of that particular comparison. I\u2019ve visited Ann Arbor a few times recently. And will be going there a few more times yet. Ann Arbor\u2019s downtown is bigger than Ithaca\u2019s. and it is easier to walk to, because there is no huge hill separating it from the campus. To me it feels more suburban, whereas Ithaca is more hippy-ish. Ann Arbor is very convenient to the Detroit suburbs, if you live there. And to Detroit. I imagine students do get some value from Detroit, but to me large swathes of it look to be in shambles. Literally. Ithaca is surrounded by fantastic state parks, and has a very \u201cchill\u201d vibe to it that is hard to match, IMO. The campus is also beautiful. I personally love it there. I take vacations there. Nearly every year. It is clearly more isolated, but most students find there is enough to do right there, most of the time. To get the most out of your time there, it is best to have a car during the upperclassman years. Or have a friend who has a car. That is not required, but it enables one to more fully experience Ithaca and the surrounding areas far from the campus. If you want to get away for a weekend,there are daily buses from campus to NYC, and boatloads of students who are from the area traveling in the vicinity all the time. But NYC is 4+ hours away. The person I am visiting in Ann Arbor wanted met o go to a football game. Because it is such a big deal there. The irony is that this person hates sports and wouldn\u2019t apply to Cornell because it had too much sports. There are certainly people at Cornell who go to all the football games. And, at least when I was there, were rabid about hockey. However a lot of people who attend Cornell would feel that this amount of obsession about sports is frankly retarded.So perhaps that\u2019s a point of campus culture distinction. It\u2019s true that Cornell has a large alumni presence in and around NYC. The alumni club there is particularly active. Much moreso than those of our other alma maters. I\u2019ve attended a number of interesting lectures they\u2019ve sponsored. I\u2019m far removed from Wall Street by now, but at least based on my framework in antiquity I would agree with @blevine\u2019s description. Except that, from what I saw, those quant jobs did not often go to people out of undergrad. Heck, the trading firm I worked for hired physics PhDs for those jobs. There\u2019s a lot of money involved they weren\u2019t messing around. Most of the undergrad hires I saw were  liberal arts majors from top schools.( Including Brown, BTW. Cornell too.)  And grads of business programs such as Wharton, NYU  and Ross. And also Cornell, even though at that time AEM was \u201cAg Ec\u201d and didn\u2019t have the reputation it has now. Either way, to get a Wall Street job, in my day at least one would need to be exceptional. And \u201cfit\u201d. I suggest do not make your whole decision based on that. Besides after a year you might get turned on by psychology, or whatever, and completely change your objectives. The new tech center in NYC is for grad programs. It is still in its infancy but I would not bank on it doing much for you, if I were you.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
