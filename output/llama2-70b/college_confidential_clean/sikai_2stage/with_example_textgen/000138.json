I\u2019m just going to comment on Haverford because I know much more about it than Richmond.  It\u2019s not dominated by women.  Yes classes are shared in the consortium, and yes, most social events are open to both Haverford and BMC students, but honestly most of the BMC students are not spending tons of time at Haverford.  They chose BMC for a reason. Second, yes you can take Penn classes, and many students do.  It\u2019s not hard to get to Penn from Haverford.  But I don\u2019t think going to Haverford just so you can take a few classes at Penn is a good reason to choose the college.  Students at Haverford want to be at Haverford, not Penn.  The culture is very different from the one at Penn, so perhaps if you love the Wharton vibe Haverford isn\u2019t a match. Haverford is filled with students who lean to the quirky/intellectual side.  It\u2019s does not have the pre-professional vibe that Penn does.  It\u2019s not very sporty, despite the fact that many students are on athletic teams.  It\u2019s just another thing they might do on the side, not close to the most important thing they do. I think you are looking at 2 great colleges and you need to take some time to think about them.  Visit if you can.  And then just go with whichever one fits you best. Good luck deciding.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
