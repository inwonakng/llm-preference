Most people don\u2019t go to a strong 4 year college with the goal of becoming a Starbucks barista upon graduation. That said, you won\u2019t likely start your first job as president of a company. IMO, don\u2019t major in\u201dwhat will make you a lot of money\u201d,  study what YOU want, what will make you thrive in college, do well and be interesting to employers. Even if you decided to  do Teach for America for a year or so after college, you may choose to go to grad school, a professional school, or move on to a job where your experience will help get a foot in the door. Enjoy college. Don\u2019t think of it as a trade school.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
