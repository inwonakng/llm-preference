You might find an easier or tougher Prof at either one of them TBH (or any other school), but both have their reputation due in part to the reputation for their academics and research.  Both schools have students who successfully get into med school each year.  Both schools have those who don\u2019t.  Whether those who don\u2019t could have if they\u2019d made a different choice is debatable. Statistics never apply to the individual. FTR, my pp to you wasn\u2019t meant to be condemnation.  It was meant to get you to seriously look at your presentation, because that matters.  Tact matters in several aspects of life. From those I\u2019ve seen from the high school I work at, the students who are most successful at getting admitted to med school are those who select a school where they are in the Top 25% of incoming students (unless at a lottery school where \u201call\u201d are really at that level with a point or two here or there being meaningless).  They also have a good work ethic from high school and don\u2019t suddenly arrive at college freshmen year changing their major (or minor) to \u201cparty.\u201d  They join things and have fun, but remember to put studying and truly learning the material as their top focus.  They ask questions when they don\u2019t understand something. My theory as to why they do better when they are in the Top 25% (GPA and SAT/ACT) is confidence level.  Those stats tend to show a similar foundation of academics.  Many classes in college start at the \u201caverage\u201d level for incoming students.  When students get into a class where they\u2019re \u201cbehind\u201d others they tend to feel they are \u201cdumb\u201d compared to the class.  That\u2019s not necessarily true as it\u2019s often a foundation gap they could fill in, but they think it is and get stressed/discouraged.  When they feel \u201cup\u201d with their peers, or on the higher end, it\u2019s a good boost to confidence letting them feel they can continue to take on anything/everything.  It\u2019s a theory (hypothesis if I want to get technical), so take it as you wish.  If you aren\u2019t in the Top 25% for either school, you might want to consider others - or know you could have to work a little bit more at the beginning to close an occasional gap or two in the introductory classes (and that\u2019s ok - you just have to actually do it). Best wishes to you no matter where you ultimately choose.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting a medical career.  You don\u2019t want to give yourself more hurdles by not understanding the whole process.  How you come across at each stage is part of that process.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
