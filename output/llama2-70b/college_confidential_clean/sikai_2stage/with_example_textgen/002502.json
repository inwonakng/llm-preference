Both have prestige and history. I could care less myself, and would strongly suggest you pay more attention to what school is a better fit. McGill is known to be relatively easy to get into(compared to similar schools in the US), but is quite challenging, and it is usually left up to the student to sink or swim. I would guess that Mt. Holyoke would give you more personal attention should you need it. Montreal gets really cold, but central MA is only marginally warmer. Do you want to be in the swing of things in a vibrant, muliticultural city, with it\u2019s excitement and distractions, or do you think you would do better if a small, supportive(hopefully), cocoon-like environment ? Both offer very good to excellent academics. As an International, job prospects would be limited.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
