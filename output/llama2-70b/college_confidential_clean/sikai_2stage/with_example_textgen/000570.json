If he doesn\u2019t pay, can you afford Cornell out of income and savings? (DO NOT take on parents loans for Cornell just because dad is pushing for it!) If you can afford Cornell: has she visited? Or does she dislike it because it\u2019s Dad\u2019s alma mater? If she doesn\u2019t like Cornell, what\u2019s your rationale as to why you\u2019d pay for her to go there? Case would be a nice compromise - nice urban area, private university, excellent for STEM, variety in class offerings, less skewed m:f ratio than at RPI. Then again, RPI is a powerhouse in STEM - in case academics matter most to her their focus is clear and strong. (The city it\u2019s in isn\u2019t the best and the m:f ratio is really skewed but the reputation in industry is great). See if she can do overnights at Vtech and Case. It\u2019ll clear things up: does she prefer a city or a college town, etc.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
