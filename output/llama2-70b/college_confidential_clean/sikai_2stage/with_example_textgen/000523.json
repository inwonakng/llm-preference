That is the key to look for in my opinion if you have a child who wants to do more than go to parties every weekend. Look to see what the college does offer, AND do the students attend! I tend to think because Kenyon is so rural that administration makes a conscious effort to provide opportunities on the weekends. Schools that have a big city near by often times don\u2019t bother because so many students just leave campus. Another reason that small/rural can contribute to a real sense of community.
