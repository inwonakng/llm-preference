Stevens does not arbitrarily withdraw scholarships. If a scholarship or financial aid offer is made contingent upon maintaining a certain minimum GPA, that will be clearly stated in the offer. I have never heard of the GPA requirements for a scholarship being changed arbitrarily after the fact of any Stevens student or graduate I know personally, nor did it happen to me when I was a student there. If you really believe Rowan and TCNJ are on the same level and attract the same calibre of students and that their outcomes are as good as Stevens (check out Payscale\u2019s survey, which puts Stevens at 15th of 1134 US colleges and universities for starting salaries and ROI on tuition, whereas Rowan and TCNJ are somewhere in the 150s I believe), well, you are mistaken. Stevens has the highest selectivity, highest SAT scores, highest average high school GPA, and highest percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school classes of entering freshmen/women of all NJ schools with the exception of Princeton University. Students clamor to attend Stevens whereas from my vantage point I see students leaving New Jersey to go to college, despite Rowan, Rutgers, TCNJ, et al being \u201cinexpensive\u201d for NJ residents. If those schools are so good and such a good value, then why do so many NJ students leave the state? Stevens and Princeton are the only NJ universities that NJ students really want to attend. In the realm of NJ public engineering schools, everyone outside of NJ has heard of Rutgers. Nobody outside of this area has heard of Rowan or TCNJ, seriously. I have had job interviews in a dozen different states. All of my interviewers knew of Stevens (and Rutgers). Many scholarship offers at all schools have minimum GPA requirements. Donors and benefactors of scholarships frequently impose conditions that the student must meet in order to retain the scholarship, and GPA is a very common one. Those are stated in the offers. I had to maintain a specific GPA to keep my scholarship at Stevens for example, and that was clearly specified from the beginning.  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
