Is price a factor for your decision?  These are all great programs, and if the money is a factor, you should probably go with the one that is most affordable so you don\u2019t have to take out debt. Penn State is obviously a much bigger university overall. You may know that NC State\u2019s engineering school is on its own (relatively new) campus across a busy road from the rest of the campus.  There\u2019s a frequent bus that runs between the two campuses.  This campus also has a lot of industry research sites which makes for a lot of neat cross-pollination between academic and corporate research. RTP is booming overall, and Raleigh is a great city and the campus is not far from downtown; there\u2019s a lot fo do. I\u2019ve never been to Blacksburg, VA and only saw Penn State once a million years ago so can\u2019t help there.  My S is interested in engineering (college class of 2025) and these colleges so I\u2019ll be watching others\u2019 responses too! Congrats again and good luck!  ```\nIs there a preference between the two colleges in the comment?\nYou MUST respond ```No preference``` if there is no explicit preference in the comment.\nYou MUST respond ```Has preference``` if there is explicit preference in the comment.\n",
