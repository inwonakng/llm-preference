As for the techie/fuzzy divide, my D is far less apologetic about her choice of study than the author of that article. She has no \u201cshame\u2026 about being a fuzzy\u201d nor \u201cinsecurity about pursuing an uncommon path\u2026\u201d She embraces her choices wholeheartedly and is passionate about what she is studying. It is indeed the case that STEM fields reign supreme at many colleges and universities these days. Humanities and the arts often get short shrift in a society where \u201creturn on investment\u201d and job placement seem to be among the most important factors in choosing an institute of higher learning. (Most of the posts on this thread concern themselves with this very issue). It is also the case that those who choose to study the humanities at Stanford can have all of the faculty support and resources they need. I see Stanford as ahead of the curve on this \u2013 while other schools are scrambling to shore up their STEM programs, Stanford has been investing some real money into its arts and humanities programs over the course of the last decade. Oh, as to the question \u201cWhat came first, the fuzzy or the techie?\u201d My answer is \u201cNeither.\u201d Back in Leonardo\u2019s day, science and art were not seen in such mutually exclusive terms; he is celebrated as much for his scientific genius as he was for his artistic genius. And, @USCWolverine \u2013 just because USC was not a good fit for my D, who happened to be seeking an intellectual vibe, does not mean that there aren\u2019t a great number of highly intellectual students and faculty there and that it isn\u2019t a fabulous school. It just wasn\u2019t the \u201cgolden ticket\u201d for my daughter.  ```\n",
