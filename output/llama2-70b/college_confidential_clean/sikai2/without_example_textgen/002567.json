          "College A: ```Carleton College```\nCollege B: ```Amherst College```\nComment: ```^I would not use the raw numbers, or even proportions, of science majors at a school to evaluate the quality of that college\u2019s programs in science. Quality is far more reliant on the professors and the resources offered at the college. One could also argue that open-curriculum schools attract a lot of STEM students who want to avoid taking humanities classes, and indeed, I have heard many STEM students make that claim. So I\u2019d avoid stereotyping and go straight for the facts. Let\u2019s also remember that undergraduate students go to get a well-rounded undergraduate education, not specifically to study one thing like a graduate program. It\u2019s important to go to a college with a solid department in the area of interest (particularly if there is interest in doing research), but either Carleton or Amherst will offer that. You could literally flip a coin and be fine. You don\u2019t have to go to the best tippy-top school in a specific discipline to get into a PhD program in that area. What you need is a good solid department and at least one professor who is willing to mentor and shepherd you through for research and grad school. I\u2019m confident you could get that at either college. A quick look at the departmental websites show that their physics faculty is about the same size - if I counted correctly, excluding visiting and emeriti professors there are 9 full-time, tenure or tenure-track faculty at Carleton and 8 at Amherst. Amherst\u2019s are, on average, more established in their careers (they are more heavily populated with full professors, who have typically been teaching 12-15+ years), but not by a whole lot - Carleton has one or two more assistant professors, it seems. The faculty at both Amherst and Carleton got their PhDs from physics departments of roughly equivalent quality, on average. A few more of Carleton\u2019s faculty went to higher-ranked programs. Both have solid representation in astronomy and astrophysics, from browsing the catalogs. Amherst may benefit from a close connection with UMass, which has a mid-ranked physics doctoral program. I don\u2019t know anything about physical facilities but those can offer a clue to the level of investment (and anticipated enrollments) a college has in particular subject areas. I will say, though, that Carleton is a top 10 producer of PhDs more generally and a top 5 producer of PhDs in the physical sciences. Amherst is in the top 30 for science and engineering PhDs overall. That could be due to a lot of different factors, but interest and investment in the sciences might be contributing factors there too. (Pomona is in the top 15 and Williams is in the top 20. This data is from the Survey of Earned Doctorates conducted by the National Science Foundation.)  ```\n",
