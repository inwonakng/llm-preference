But for those venturing into a double major such as accounting & finance, then quality of the finance program & its students does matter. Not discussed in the post above are the tremendous benefits of IU\u2019s Hutton Honors College\u2013regardless of one\u2019s major\u2013and the benefits of Business Honors & its clubs as well as advantages of being a direct admit to the business school which enables one to build meaningful professional relationships from the first semester on campus. Recruiting has changed over the past 27 years. Best to be part of a nationally respected business school if seeking competitive positions outside of the school\u2019s geographic region. Telling one to disregard the affiliated MBA program at each business school is very poor advice with respect to the rapidly evolving changes in marketplace demands. It is almost as ridiculous as an earlier posted who suggested that you ignore the advantages of the Hutton Honors College (to which OP barely qualified). The people with whom you associate during your college years will have a dramatic effect on both your undergraduate experience & upon future professional connections.  ```\n",
