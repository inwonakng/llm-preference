Harvard is the easy and obvious choice here because admission to and payment for medical school is like undergraduate but on steroids.  Admissions rates hover around 3-5% for even a mid level medical school.  Costs are above 80,000 a year right now, and are going to be even higher in four years.  So, when people say take the money at Georgia Tech they are assuming that your chance of admission and cost will be the same.  I disagree.  With 3% admission rates, Harvard is clearly the better choice for admission to medical school, even, as I readily agreed, GT is a great school and a fine choice standing alone.  But, from the financial point of view, what you want for medical school is either admission to a low cost or free medical school (Baylor or Case Western) or merit money from the medical school.  If you don\u2019t get that, medical school is going to cost you nearly 400,000.  The medical schools compete for the very best applicants with merit money.  So, financially, that is the goal, to have such a stellar record that you can go to medical school at a far lower cost, and I would pay 80,000 all day for the chance to a) cut my medical school bill down and b) improve my chances for admission. And, I am not, really not, picking on GT.  I think it is a great school.  But for kicks, just go to the websites of the top medical schools and see where the students came from.  Harvard, Yale and the like are overrepresented.  (Just to be clear, I did not go to Harvard I am just looking at the facts).  How many GT undergraduates are at Harvard medical school.  How many Harvard undergraduates? And one more note for admission.  This forum is littered with threads that discuss people who failed to recognize just how tough it is to get into one of the elite schools.  Well, virtually every single medical school is sub-10% admission and requires the whole package of grades, EC, recommendations and more just to be considered. By way of example, George Washington Medical school has a three percent admission rate, lower than Harvard undergraduate.   You can\u2019t just get A\u2019s and get in, any more than you get get into Harvard that way.  All these people just assuming you can go or go to Harvard for med school, as if you could just walk up and get in.  No way.  So, if my dream was to be a doctor, and Harvard could facilitate that, it would be worth 80,000, particularly if was a way to cut down the huge cost of medical school.  ```\n",
