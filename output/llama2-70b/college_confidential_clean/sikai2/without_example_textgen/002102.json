You can then evaluate the total difference in price. Keep in mind that going away also has some downsides- you won\u2019t be able to go home for the weekend if you need to de-stress from your crazy roommate or if you are sick, travel is a lot more expensive (you\u2019ll probably fly for Thanksgiving break, at least), and you\u2019ll miss family events. Also consider the following: Is your OOS scholarship guaranteed? Do you have to maintain a certain GPA? What if you need a 5th year? What is the cost of study abroad? Do you pay your current tuition or some different amount? What are the reciprocal schools? If you change your mind and switch majors, what is the effect on cost, graduation, etc.? What are the most common firms hiring from the program, starting salary, etc. etc. ?  ```\n",
