Worry a lot more about do you really want a mathematics major at Cornell, and why not at Michigan?  Mathematics majors will require you to work hard. An undergraduate business degree is less valuable down the road,  in comparison,  unless you are taking a lot of quantitative classes.   At Michigan I take it you would take a lot of math though.       Do you want an MBA? Then the harder major of mathematics will go a long way if its paired with a great job option in NYC later, for a few years and then your application to Wharton etc.  Cornell is very tied to New York city and opening a new campus on Roosevelt Island , Cornell Tech.  Look into Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island. Its located at Google in NYC right now.    Its pretty far from the Ithaca campus, but looks interesting to me: https://tech.cornell.edu/  ```\n",
