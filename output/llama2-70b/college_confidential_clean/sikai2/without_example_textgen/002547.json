Niche rank - UNC-44    BC-80 \u2013 ah, this must be the right ranking! SAT/ACT score range - UNC 1280-1460 and 27-32        BC 1340-1510 and 30-33 Student population - UNC ~ 29,000     BC ~ 14,000 Endowment - UNC ~ 3billion      BC ~ 2billion Endowment per student - BC&gt;UNC So, this business of UNC being soooo much better than BC shows merely simple ignorance. And, by the way, the theology requirement is, I believe, any two courses available from the extensive offerings (intellectually stimulating, thought-provoking subjects \u2013 none of which try to ram religion down one\u2019s throat) that are one term each. And philosophy?! No requirement that I know of, but if philosophy is a turn-off then it raises the question of whether one should be in college at all, as it is perhaps the only time in life where one is exposed to the great thinkers through the ages. Should be required of all students!  ```\n",
