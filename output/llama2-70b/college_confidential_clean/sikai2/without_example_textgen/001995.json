Let that sink in. Also, Duke was 24 and Berkeley was 9. You weren\u2019t referencing the latest data. I\u2019d also like to point out that this appears to be self reported data from a website called \u201cefinancialcareers\u201d. You can\u2019t compare that to rankings from the WSJ and the NY Times which clearly show that Duke graduates fair better. As far as Goldman Sachs is concerned, your own link (\u201cefinancialcareers\u201d again) has Duke at 17 and Berkeley at 20.  ```\n",
