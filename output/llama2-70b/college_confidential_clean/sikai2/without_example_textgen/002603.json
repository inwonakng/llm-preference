Here is a report on the colleges with the biggest/most successful entrepreneurial activity: https://files.pitchbook.com/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2015_2016_Edition.pdf Biomedical engineering is definitely an option for you, and it builds on Penn\u2019s world renowned hospital and medical school. There is a lot of cutting edge research happening through collaborations between the engineering and medical school at Penn. For example: https://news.upenn.edu/news/university-pennsylvania-celebrate-launch-penn-center-health-devices-and-technology If you want to be the best engineer, I feel it is best to go where the most engineering opportunities are available. The M&T program has a lot of business requirements, it is dual degree after all, but if you see that you are no longer interested in the business part you can just drop it and focus on engineering. This was a article about Yale CS: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-06/want-a-job-in-silicon-valley-after-yale-good-luck-with-that At the end of the day however, fit is very important. I feel the biggest point that you d have to understand is the difference is academic culture and student interests between the two schools. Both are excellent choices. Where do you see yourself fitting best?  ```\n",
