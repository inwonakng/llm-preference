I\u2019m not an expert, but it seems to me it might not be legal for universities to share with each other who got in and went where. If they can\u2019t do that, the data must be self-reported by the students, in which case how can it be reliable or complete? Also, I wonder how Stanford characterizes a student who gets into, say, Harvard, Yale and Stanford, and enrolls at Harvard. It\u2019s a win for Harvard in cross-admits with Stanford, but how does Stanford reflect that the student was a Yale-Stanford cross-admit and chose to attend neither school? Also, is there double-counting in the total numbers of cross-admits (i.e., does that kid show up as a Stanford cross-admit with both Harvard and Yale)? In this regard, the Today Show reported this morning that the set of quadruplets who all were admitted to Harvard and Yale (and at least one of which was also admitted to Stanford) have all chosen Yale (see the thread on this subject, also here: http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/ohio-quadruplets-accepted-ivies-will-attend-yale-together-n753146) - so I guess there\u2019s a real-life illustration of the problem in accounting for cross-admits to multiple places. Finally, as I\u2019ve said elsewhere, assuming the numbers on the Stanford slide are correct, a 10% swing in any direction with any school looks like a big shift but represents 21 or fewer people. Given that HYPS all have 70-80% yields, the overlap in the admitted students must be small. Also, I would guess, many students give a lot of weight to geography in making their decision. I would be very interested to know the choices of Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and West Coast students cross-admitted with Stanford and any of HYP. [/quote]  Note that those quadruplets all by themselves probably represent a ~2% shift to Yale in its cross-admit match-up with Harvard, which illustrates how small the actual cross-admit numbers are and how little one can read into cross-admit trends. @Cue7 - thanks for all that very useful information.  ```\n",
