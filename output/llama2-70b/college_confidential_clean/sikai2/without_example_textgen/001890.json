Although on paper housing is not guaranteed for your last years, students are able to find on campus housing if they desire to stay on campus (another dorm is being built) and off campus housing is easy to secure if desired. Settle in your freshman year and then apply for assistant research positions.  With both the University Hospital and Children\u2019s Hospital on campus, undergraduates often assist graduate students.  This is a terrific way to spend time learning and get paid. Use the resources; free tutoring is available\u2026  On the other side, if you get great grades and decide to be a tutor, the pay is more than double PA minimum wage\u2026 CMU and Penn have a very different culture and student body.  Visit if you are able\u2026 A few things to think about at any elite private school.  Will it bother you to be surrounded by students with extraordinary economic advantages?  You will find your own group of friends and they will likely be lifelong friends, but it sometimes takes a while to sort out.  Often the differences are purely economical (dining out, entertainment, extravagant vacations on breaks) and you may find that wealthier students arrive having already taken (are repeating) freshman courses.  Don\u2019t despair, there are plenty of opportunities to work on campus and truly bright self-motivated students have already learned to independently study (a huge advantage).  ```\n",
