Its is very dominated by women, because Bryn Mawr is a women\u2019s college and Haverford is about 52% or a little more,  women.  Since students mix freely between the two adjacent LACs, there is a definite dominance of women and less men to date if that matters to you. The gender imbalance at Haverford/Bryn Mawr and the very small size makes socializing a bit more confined than a larger school like Richmond. Haverford student body  is focused on  a very strong honor code. This means tests are not proctored. Here is some ongoing discussion of this honor code.  The writers here look to be excellent ! http://haverfordclerk.com/an-examination-of-precedent-in-the-current-honor-code-and-how-to-restore-it/ http://haverfordclerk.com/why-tyranny-of-the-majority-at-haverford-is-not-silencing-free-speech/ Richmond would be a larger student body with more students who may be preprofessionally focused. Haverford is the more intellectual/liberal tight knit liberal arts campus. Haverford seems somewhat sporty to me, especially the girls.  ```\n",
