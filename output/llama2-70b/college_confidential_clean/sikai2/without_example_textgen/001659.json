It is also worth noting that several elite private schools have engineering programs that are ranked poorly because they are relatively small. The rankings don\u2019t always measure the quality of research output. They often look at the quantity. You can bet your bottom dollar that I\u2019d go to Harvard\u2019s SEAS over Georgia Tech or Michigan even though those programs are ranked far higher. If you want to get a sense of the quality of some of Duke\u2019s engineering professors, you should check out these links: http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/04/duke-professor-adrian-bejan-wins-prestigious-benjamin-franklin-medal https://stories.duke.edu/beyond-materials-from-invisibility-cloaks-to-satellite-communications http://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/new-faculty-vahid-tarokh Also, be extremely skeptical of people who make blanket assertions without citing their sources. http://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-colleges-for-software-developers-2014-10 Duke at 8. Michigan at 9. https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/11/where-did-venture-capitalists-go-to-college/ 32 VC investment partners with Duke undergrad degrees. 26 from Michigan (a school that is 5 times larger).  ```\n",
