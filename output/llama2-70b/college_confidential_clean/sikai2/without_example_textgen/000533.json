I wanted to post something on this discussion because I feel that there\u2019s some misinformation being put out here, or at least information that doesn\u2019t jibe with my own experience. I looked at Vassar early on in my college search. It\u2019s a great school, but it felt too much like the private high school I attended in San Francisco. That\u2019s a personal perspective, obviously. My high school teammate is now playing at Vassar and loves it. My final college choices were Oberlin, Carleton, Macalester, Bates and Kenyon. All great schools. Of these, Kenyon felt the most comfortable for me. I\u2019m interested in the humanities (a likely English major) and Kenyon\u2019s offerings in this area seemed to be the strongest of those colleges. I loved the look of Kenyon\u2019s campus, and after 4 years of high school in the middle of San Francisco, I was also attracted to the rural setting of Kenyon. As to the drinking culture at Kenyon, some of what\u2019s being presented on this thread doesn\u2019t ring true to me. Of course, there is drinking at Kenyon. But I have never felt pressured to drink, there are many students who do not drink, and I have rarely seen anyone out of control at a party. In fact, Kenyon students seem especially attuned to the dangers of excessive drinking, and we are all educated about the known linkages between alcohol consumption and other problems like sexual assault. I think Kenyon\u2019s administration does a great job in this regard. As to Kenyon\u2019s Greek scene, I think this may be misunderstood unless you\u2019ve experienced it up close. Kenyon\u2019s Greek organizations are more like community service clubs than traditional fraternities and sororities. Yes, most of the Greek organizations throw parties, but they are open to the whole Kenyon community. Fraternities and sororities at Kenyon don\u2019t live together (generally) and I\u2019ve always found them to be quite inclusive even if you\u2019re not a member. I think they add a lot to the campus social scene. The assertions on this thread that Kenyon has problems with alcohol consumption are untrue in my experience. I\u2019d suggest - respectfully - that unless you go to Kenyon, or are an alum, parent, or employee, then perhaps you don\u2019t have the highest-quality information to report.  ```\n",
