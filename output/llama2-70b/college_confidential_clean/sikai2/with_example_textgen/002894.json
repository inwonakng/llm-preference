The reputation of Hopkins being brutal for pre-med has for some reason persisted. Maybe it is not true as you say,  but I a far from the only one with this perception. Personally I have a few friends who did pre-med at Hopkins and they felt it was rather brutal. Also they food the physical environment rather stressful. Cornel and Hopkins definitely are more grade deflated and rough than Dartmouth though. The advantage for Hopkins as a pre-med is that you could also get involved in some great research as an undergrad and boost your med school application. As for the prestige point, definitely it is rather subjective, but for undergrad Hopkins has a lower yield rate (40.6%) than both Cornell (52.7%) and Dartmouth (51.4%) and tends to lose the cross admit battle with both. While this is not a perfect measure of prestige, it does reveal desirability to an extent. There is not a big actual different but Cornell and Dartmouth probably benefit because they are ivies.  ```\n",
