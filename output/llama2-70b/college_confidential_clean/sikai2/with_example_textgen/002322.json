That alone accounts for a 3%-4% difference in pay. @Alexandre Your good at making stuff up and presenting it as factual.\"\" I am merely stating a statistical reality. If you look at average starting salaries at Cornell, Michigan, Northwestern or Penn, there is an increase of 3%-4% annually. For example, the average Penn starting salary for the SEAS in 2012 was $69,000, 2013 was $72,000, 2014 was $75,000, in 2015 was $83,000 and in 2016 was $88,000. Since Cornell\u2019s report is for 2017 graduates, while Michigan\u2019s and Penn\u2019s report is for 2016 graduates, the comparison isn\u2019t entirely fair. \u201cAlso failing to normalize for size, UMich has 5 times as many engineering students as Penn. that would put Penn at nearly 200 vs 149 for UMich after a simple normalization\u2026\u201d Penn lists 68 CS majors out of the 177 who reported their placement and salaries from the SEAS at Penn, compared to 110 CS majors out of the 406 who reported their placement and salaries from the CoE  at Michigan. So it is nowhere near five times more. Like I said, Michigan\u2019s College of Engineering (roughly 6,500 undergraduate students) is 4 times larger than Penn\u2019s SEAS (close to 1,700 undergraduate students, so not 5 times larger), but when it comes to CS majors, Michigan and Penn have roughly the same numbers. As I stated above, Cornell, Michigan and Northwestern have a more balanced concentration of engineering majors than Penn, which seems to focus disproportionately in CS/CE.  Even if you adjust for size, Michigan places a significantly higher number of graduates as Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft than Penn. \u201c\u2026but I did meet a UMich grad working at the Genious Bar so Apple does hire them.\u201d Hehe! You got it there!  I did go to Genius Bar a couple of times, but I never had the presence of mind to ask the service reps for their resumes!   ```\n",
