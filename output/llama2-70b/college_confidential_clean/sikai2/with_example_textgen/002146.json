What I can say is that the undergraduate experience at Stanford has been absolutely amazing for my D and she is 100% certain that she made the right choice in selecting S over H, Y, and P. My D., a humanities kid through and through, is in SLE \u2013 a living/learning program similar to Y\u2019s Directed Studies and P\u2019s HUM Sequence, but better in that it includes a very vibrant residential component: all of her SLE classes take place in the late afternoon at the dorm and discussions continue well into the night. There is resident faculty that lives on site that regularly opens his home to students and puts together events, BBQs, and field trips on what seems to be practically a daily basis. D.'s other classes are outstanding and her profs are exceedingly accessible \u2013 not to mention utterly brilliant and tops in their respective fields. Forget prestige \u2013 both schools are prestigious. The bottom line is it comes down to fit: Stanford has a very west coast feel \u2013 its student body is quirky and irreverent, every bit as accomplished as those of its peer schools, but a bit more laid back, IMO. My D would not have \u201c[appreciated] the \u2026 \u2018preppy\u2019 vibe.\u201d I would have no concerns about Stanford\u2019s undergraduate focus \u2013 from what I\u2019ve seen, the school is very invested in creating the best undergraduate experience imaginable for its students. D\u2019s approach is the opposite of that of @TiggerDad\u2019s son: H, Y, and P will be there for grad school; she sought to select the best possible undergraduate experience in the best possible environment. For D, that was Stanford.  ```\n",
