I\u2019m also a part of those exact same chats and groups, and if you look at the roommate spreadsheet (which is still a fraction of the incoming students) you\u2019ll see a lot more variety in partying preference. Wherever you go people will be into different things, but WashU actually has a great student culture where you\u2019re not pressured or expected to do things you don\u2019t want to do. I and the girls I\u2019ve talked with so far are more into pizza and movies (but to each her own, of course). And no matter how much people want to party, we\u2019re all going to get our butts kicked by hard (but engaging and cool!) classes and have to study a lot. Like @Hamurtle said, WashU is super collaborative, and GroupMes don\u2019t provide the whole picture  Best of luck with your decisions!  ```\n",
