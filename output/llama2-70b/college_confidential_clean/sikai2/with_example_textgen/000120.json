It is located in Haverford \u2013 a wealthy suburb about 20 minutes from Philly, with shops off campus. Towns on the Main Line are about a mile apart, all connected by commuter rail to Philly. The area is considered one of the loveliest suburban areas in Philadelphia, with large homes from the turn of the century. Haverford is also distinctive because of its Quaker traditions of mutual respect and notions of community, which influence everything from self-scheduled final exams to the tradition of Plenary, when students meet to reaffirm the Honor Code. Students do very well after graduation but it does not have a business program. Haverford and Bryn Mawr students can take up to 2 classes a term at U Penn, though the classes must be classes which are not regularly offered at either Haverford or Bryn Mawr, and Wharton and Engineering classes are excluded.  ```\n",
