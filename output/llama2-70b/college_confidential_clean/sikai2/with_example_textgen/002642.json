Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```Those two schools are so different, to compare and contrast should be easy. Our child also had the choice of GT and Olin (among others) and the decision didn\u2019t take very long. The feeling was that Olin beats GT (from our student\u2019s perspective) in research opportunities, culture, and lifestyle. The last two are really subjective, but it is worth mentioning that Olin has a very cooperative atmosphere. From all reports I have seen, GT is more of a competitive (if not quite cut throat) scene. There are no frats at Olin \u2013 and it would be difficult to imagine any greek organization ever happening there (not just because of their size, also because of their culture). On the other hand, Geek organizations thrive. There are no varsity sports at Olin. While both schools have traditions, at Olin they are still making traditions (\u201cyou get to be a giant instead of standing on the shoulders of giants\u201d). As far as research opportunities, Olin is undergraduate-only, First Year students are routinely involved in research. I\u2019m sure GT undergraduates get research opportunities, but it is undoubtedly much more difficult to find the opportunities.  ```\n",
