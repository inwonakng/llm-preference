Secondly, I doubt med school adcoms pay any attention to acceptance rates, particularly a situation of 20% vs 30%.  [quote] Then why does Rochester have a higher medical school acceptance rate? So, would I have a better chance of med school there? [/quote]  Even if this were true, we may not know the details or how their reported rates are derived/manipulated. Either way, how would a reported acceptance rate affect YOU?  ```\n",
