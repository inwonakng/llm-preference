The Admissions Office isn\u2019t judging you anymore. Admitted students are part of the Penn family. Now Penn needs to ensure that you are supported and successful. You have what it takes to succeed, or they would not have admitted you, and Penn has the classes, support, resources, and opportunities to make this a life-changing four years for you. The critical thing is to connect early with people who can guide you to access and take full advantage of those resources and begin that process early. As you begin to do that, realize that at Penn rigorous academics is only a piece of the puzzle. Getting involved in extracurricular activities like research, internships, clubs, travel abroad, etc. are a big part of the experience. Developing a social network is also important. Social connections often begin with pre-orientation activities, which you should participate in, your dorm, and the clubs you join. It is helpful to make an effort to make friends early because everyone is trying to make friends at that point. It will be challenging, but you will be a big success!  ```\n",
