Just how much is this the case there, and how would it affect someone not active in athletics? (My son played soccer in high school, also some ultimate and tennis, but he is not at a level to play on a college team.) [/quote]  I don\u2019t think this will be a big deal at either school. At most schools, even SLACs, athletes (and the men/women attracted to them) often form cliques. It goes hand in hand with team bonding. However, it usually doesn\u2019t affect other students, unless they are dying to be part of who they perceive to be the \u201cin\u201d crowd and get rejected. And we\u2019re not talking about giant powerhouses of NCAA Division I here.  [quote] The study abroad program [/quote]  We like Carleton\u2019s specific options, but both schools will offer excellent opportunities. One difference worth noting: the Carleton trimester-based academic calendar enables a student with demanding academic requirements (for a double major, for example) to go abroad for the six-week winter break (Thanksgiving to New Year\u2019s) or for a 10-week trimester. In the latter case, the student can still take classes in Northfield for the other two trimesters, if desired. (Or you can go abroad for half a year to a year.)  [quote] We\u2019re in Illinois, and one of my son\u2019s preferences is to get out of the midwest. (I\u2019m from the east coast originally, and still have family there.) [/quote]  There you go. Amherst wins, if this is important to your son. For us, it was the opposite. My daughter will be experiencing something very different by going to the Midwest, which is one reason she turned down all of her California choices. I agree with your son that it is important to explore something different.  [quote] Amherst\u2019s endowment is quite a bit larger \u2013 does that have much of an impact on differences between the schools? [/quote]  Not that I noticed, but there may some advantages. Amherst has a slightly better student:faculty ratio. My impression is that Amherst provides slightly better financial aid, but each person\u2019s experience may be different. On the other hand, Amherst has a higher sticker price, and Carleton spends more on R&D (can\u2019t find my source, but I saw the figures somewhere). So who knows?  [quote] Financial aid: Amherst\u2019s aid is \u201cno loan\u201d. Does that mean we can\u2019t do a loan (i.e., the Federal Direct Stafford loan) even if we want to? And if we can, would it be on top of the grant they\u2019ve already given us, or would it displace some of it? (Their website seems to suggest the former; I plan to speak with their FA office tomorrow.) With the loan, the FA packages are very similar. [/quote]  You can always borrow a Parent Plus loan up to the expected family contribution. It will not replace any grants or scholarships. Eligibility for Federal Stafford loans, subsidized or unsubsidized, should be stated on the financial aid offer. Good luck! As others will tell you, your son can\u2019t go wrong with either choice. Great schools.  ```\n",
