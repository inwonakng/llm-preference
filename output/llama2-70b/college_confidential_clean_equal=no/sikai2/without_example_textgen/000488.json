Never got a NY \u201cwanna be\u201d vibe at Vassar, felt very down to earth, not pretentious, and I appreciated the formerly-women\u2019s college vibe of a school with no football team and no greek life. Kenyon feels \u2013 your mileage may vary \u2013 like a place where city, private school kids go. Of course, that is not the only demographic at Kenyon, but it definitely feels more wealthy, more homogenous (and is) than some peer schools. Greek life is about 25% at Kenyon, and though students don\u2019t live in the greek life houses, the housing office designates certain blocks of dorm rooms  for members of specific chapters, so that greek life members live together. So yes, I agree with other posters that I perceive the schools the flip of how you did. But I\u2019m a middle aged mom, so take it with a grain of salt.  ```\n",
