I\u2019m glad you found something that worked for you and your family! You do not need to start researching grad schools now  It\u2019s too early! Let her settle into some career goals and research/professional interests first. I wouldn\u2019t start thinking about a list until junior year at the earliest, once she\u2019s gotten a chance to get some research experience and a little solidity in her career goals and interests.    Also, for the sake of the usefulness of this thread over the long-term your daughter\u2019s doctor is wrong. It is not true that students have to attend a top-tier university to have hopes of getting into graduate school; this is true across fields.* I have a PhD in psychology and I went to a small LAC that is very good but not ranked as highly as Kenyon. Per capita, small liberal arts colleges produce more PhD graduates than large research universities. Colleges like Kalamazoo, Hillsdale, Allegheny, Hendrix, Franklin & Marshall and Occidental are in the top 50 producers of science and engineering (including psychology) PhDs per capita. I wouldn\u2019t say a student is better off at a small LAC. It\u2019s more that a student who has found a good fit school for her can get into graduate school from wherever she goes, as long as she pursues the kinds of experiences that graduate schools value. Assuming that\u2019s a PhD program in psychology, that would be research experience assisting a professor in their research group, summer research experiences (preferably at another campus and/or with other professors, so she can grow her network), presenting research at conferences, maybe getting a publication (not necessary, but a nice cherry on top). They also include good letters of recommendation and writing a strong personal statement that coherently discusses research interests and career goals, but those things tend to come more naturally after a student has had these kinds of experiences and connections. Good grades and high GRE scores are also necessary. And if she\u2019s interested in clinical psychology, clinical volunteering experience is necessary as well. A sufficiently motivated student could get that anywhere - a great small liberal arts college or a great large public university. The doctoral students I knew (at my own program and those I created networks with) came from across the spectrum of colleges and universities, from top-tier places to small regional public universities. *I should add that in some fields - like math or philosophy - undergrad college may matter more.  ```\n",
