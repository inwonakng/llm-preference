We have the same choices but admitted students day(s) pushed it clearly to Boston College. Facilities. The vibe of the kids and smiles. Commitment to core and core renewal was excellent. My D is a premed and total STEM focus. Having a commitment to liberal arts for all as part of the educational process is important to her.  No wrong choices here for you.  USNWR has Gtown at 20 and BC 30.  Forbes and elsewhere are similar. BCs business school is even better. PreMed counseling center is better at BC in our opinion as well. Know folks who went through both. Follow your heart and your head will be fine  ```\n",
