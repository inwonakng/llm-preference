Mind, I\u2019m one of those guys that literally cringes when I hear Marines, sailors, and/or airmen referred to as \u201csoldiers.\u201d But as I recall, the Ivy League features only 8 schools, and the easiest one to get into is Cornell.  What\u2019s Cornell\u2019s acceptance rate?  10%?  For me, to call more than a handful of public universities \u201cpublic ivies\u201d would have no meaning whatsoever.  Is San Diego St. (35% acceptance rate) often referred to as a public ivy? You get my drift  Again, to be absolutely clear, I\u2019m sure UIUC is an excellent school.  ```\n",
