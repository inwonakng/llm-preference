I know some extremely intelligent students in the Top 1% score ranges for testing and ranking in their classes that didn\u2019t make it in. I thought GT was a match for me (34, Top 3% class, 3.9 UW) until I got deferred EA as well as some of my very qualified classmates. It\u2019s brutal even in-state, and I would consider it a reach for pretty much all in-state students unless you\u2019re a Val or Sal at one of the approved schools.  ```\n",
