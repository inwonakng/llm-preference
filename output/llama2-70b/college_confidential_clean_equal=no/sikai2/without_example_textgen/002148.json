FYI, and FWIW, in recent years (in voting with their feet) most cross-admits choose Stanford and that would be my choice as well.  The top tier in the US is Harvard-Stanford, and that is not about to change.  Your observation that Stanford \u201cwill gain more prestige in the coming years\u201d is dead-on. The arc of Stanford\u2019s trajectory in US academia has been amazing since the 1950\u2019s and shows no sign of diminishing. I have never been sold on the \u201cthis school blah blah blah undergraduates, while this school blah blah blah graduates.\u201d  That argument is over-hyped and specious (popular with parents and with those who are not professional academics at the very best schools).  The best scholars are the most passionate about their work and that passion is shared with their students. Again, congrats. Two great schools. Can\u2019t go wrong. Best of luck wherever you go/row,  ```\n",
