    "user_input": "College A: ```Bowdoin College```\nCollege B: ```Middlebury College```\nComment: ```Three of my personal favorite NESCACS. Can\u2019t go wrong! Each is a little different, and take my impresions with a grain of salt as they are subjective of course. I think (overall) all three schools are pretty equal in your academic areas of interest- some might be stronger than others in certain areas but overall it\u2019s relative as all three are top notch schools. Bates- wonderful community. Gorgeous (although small) campus/architecture. Very friendly vibe, students are welcoming and the close knit community feel is palpable. Strong academics, just a lovely school. Has the month long May plan which is useful for starting summer internships early or for traveling abroad. Major difference to me between it and the other two is a more laid back vibe. Doesn\u2019t feel as intense. Definitely collaborative. Best food of the three. Nephew is a current student. D15 would have applied regular decision if her ED school had fallen through. Bates is very high on D18\u2019s list this year. Bowdoin- neat school. Lovely campus in it\u2019s own quirky way. Location near Portland is nice, it is more suburban than rural if that matters to you. Great if you like the ocean. Pretty far away from mountains though if you like having them in your back yard. Of course great academics. Personally, I sensed a little more academic elitism at Bowdoin than the other three. I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, and perhaps I have used the wrong word. Just seemed a little bit more academcially snobby than the other two. Not sure how collaborative/competitive, don\u2019t know enough kids who go there.  D15 liked Bowdoin a lot, would have applied if her ED school fell through. D18 didn\u2019t even look at Bowdoin, too intense of a school for her. Middlebury- awesome location in the mountains, lovely campus. Feels considerably bigger than the other two schools. D15 went ED and attends. Loving her expereince, it is the right mix of academic intensity and fun for her. Raves about (most) of the professors/classes she has taken. Has found Midd more collaborative than competitive (she is env policy major). Heavily involved in the Mountain Club. Knows women on the cross country/track team and they are a great group. Jan Plan is very popular- fun to have the one block class in the middle of ski season. Lots of students ski. D18 not interested in Midd, a bit too intense for her. Good luck!  ```\n",
