I much prefer a larger campus and  it\u2019s easy to get around on bike. I also agree that as far as rowing you\u2019re going to placed higher on the pecking order of athletes at Princeton than at  Stanford.  Rowing is part of the culture and esprit of an ivy school.  Stanford athletics is part of the Pac12\u2026 the most competitive conference in the US but also a.completely different athletics conference and culture compared to the ivy conference.  ```\n",
