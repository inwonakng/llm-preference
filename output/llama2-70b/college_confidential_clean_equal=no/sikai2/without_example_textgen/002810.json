So, sure, only 20.5% at Hamilton may have used traditional standardized scoring.  But beats me how one then makes assumptions about which pool is brighter, more inclusive, or more apt to be the experience OP seeks. I get that you\u2019re trying to suggest the  lower scoring students at Bates are\"\"weaker\"\" than at Ham. But, so what?  Bates isn\u2019t scraping the bottom of the barrel; they\u2019re looking at other than scores, in the first place. It\u2019s common on CC for some to assume kids are hiding their scores, are truly weaker, if they don\u2019t submit.  But that\u2019s \u201cthe Kool-Aid.\u201d  If one really knew these two colleges, they wouldn\u2019t be trying to imply anything about Bates being lesser. Bates is a little different in that community partnerships are popular. Not just service, if one chooses, but the opportunity, eg, to work with different sorts of local, state, or regional groups in hybrid participation, service and academic ways- sometimes on-going, sometimes for the senior project.  There are other contextual differences.  To try to boil this down to a projection that there\u2019s a huge quality gap based on scores around the 25th percentile being lower is, IMO, futile.  It misses the point.  ```\n",
