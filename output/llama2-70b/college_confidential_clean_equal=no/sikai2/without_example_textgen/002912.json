    "user_input": "College A: ```Cornell University```\nCollege B: ```Johns Hopkins University```\nComment: ```@stevensPR Overall yield can be manipulated, sure, but RD yield cannot. Btw Dartmouth nd Cornell accept a % of their class ED that is similar to Hopkins. For the class of 2020: Hopkins RD Yield: ~27.5% Dartmouth RD yield: ~37% Cornell RD yield: ~40.9% (Penn RD yield: ~50%+, only since you mentioned Penn manipulating yield - it does but still has a high RD yield) Saying that Hopkins admits more academically accomplished students is just not true. Dartmouth SAT (V+M) middle range (old) class of 2020: (670+680) - (780+780) Cornell SAT (V+M) middle range (old) class of 2020      : (650+680) - (750+780) Comparison to Cornell is not apples to apples since Cornell has some non-tradiditonal program that attract students with lower scores. Even that small difference does not suggest a actual difference in student quality. As for Dartmouth, it has slightly higher stats on paper. Also many top schools do not solely focus on scores and GPA, they dont mind admitting some special students who have created a company or have done something else out of the box but have lower stats.  ```\n",
