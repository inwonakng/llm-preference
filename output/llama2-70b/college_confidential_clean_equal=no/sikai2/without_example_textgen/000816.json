Which is what I\u2019d personally say as well- and it also seems to be the perspective of most recent grads. With one exception, and I mean, he\u2019s entitled to his view, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s correct regarding outcomes (at least for the present- he\u2019s a 2005 grad). Since he referenced Amherst and Williams in specific, there are data points from the three schools showing that the salaries across these schools are similar (CollegeScoreCard & PayScale), that tech/consulting/other prestigious gigs recruit similarly from the Claremont Colleges, and that Pomona is similar in terms of students receiving competitive fellowships or getting a PhD. Maybe back in 2005 Pomona truly did suffer when it came to pre-professional opportunities, recruiting, and such, but that hasn\u2019t been my personal experience as a 2016 grad. I know Pomona definitely stepped up for funding internships and elevating career services in the four years I was there. I actually landed a couple of interviews in NYC where the employers spoke highly of the school, so it\u2019s on the rise.  ```\n",
