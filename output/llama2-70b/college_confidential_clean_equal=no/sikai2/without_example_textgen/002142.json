Both Princeton and Stanford are beautiful campuses. And you have a tough decision. Stanford\u2019s sports program is always #1. Stanford football is a perennial Top 10-20 team. The Stanford men\u2019s soccer team is the 2-tIme defending national champion. The Stanford women\u2019s soccer team is currently #1 in the country and a perennial College Cup (Final 4) participant. The women\u2019s volleyball team won the championship last year. Swimming, tennis, blah, blah, blah, you get the point. About 15-20% of the campus are recruited athletes at Stanford. I do want to say that there are more than few cold (32 degrees ish) mornings here in the winter, so hopefully, Stanford will let you use the indoor ERG\u2019s instead of hitting the Bay.  :))  ```\n",
