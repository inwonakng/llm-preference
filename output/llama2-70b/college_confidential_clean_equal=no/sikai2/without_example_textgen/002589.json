Seriously, there are 24 Carl\u2019s in Rome with two History professors right now, taking their full load  of 3 classes: 1 on ancient Rome, can\u2019t remember the second - maybe Renaissance time period?, and 3 was some sort of writing focus).   If going with a professor and 24 Carl\u2019s isn\u2019t your idea of adventure, there were literally dozens more individual program opportunities to choose from for study abroad. We never considered Amherst/Williams/Swat, though we did visit and son thought Haverford was OK, but not really his crowd.    I second/third the posters who have said you can't go wrong with these two choices.  Relax, and let your son pick the school that feels right for him today!     ```\n",
