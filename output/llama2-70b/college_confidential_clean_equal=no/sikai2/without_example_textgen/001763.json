And given how large the school is, the alum network is not only strong but large.  Someone brought up a point about if the OP wants to get a venture funded, s/he would be better off with an MIT background\u2026 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s necessarily true.  It\u2019s highly likely the UMich network would be helpful for funding, not something to be overlooked. Much of this is a question about how much money a small difference is worth to an individual.  Only OP knows his family\u2019s financial situation, but for most people with a financial situation with less than 9 figures in net worth, $250k is a substantial investment.  Would MIT be \u201cbetter\u201d for some things if cost were equal?  Sure.  But arguing that the differential is worth $250k is a much tougher sell, especially since the alternative (UMich) is of such high quality.  ```\n",
