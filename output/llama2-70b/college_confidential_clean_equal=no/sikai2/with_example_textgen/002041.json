Assume she\u2019ll get a degree in Economics. Another issue is that she didn\u2019t make or apply for honors at UT which puts her at a disadvantage. (The order of priority for opportunities, contacts, etc, would be BHP or Plan II -&gt;McCombs-&gt;Economics with Honors-&gt;Economics). Does she want economics or Business? Economics can be more flexible and can allow her to add some electives to personalize her profile. She may be able to add a Business certificate to it, develop expertise in US culture (through classes in American studies, African American studies, Hispanic studies)nifbshe plans to work for a TNC that does business with the US. UT will also be much more diverse (ethnically and socio economically) than SMU. SMU business offers excellent contacts, networking, internships, etc. It is also rather homogeneous. So if your concern is internships and living in a big city, SMU would have the edge. If you want diversity, UT has the edge. In terms of political vibe, SMU is conservative and UT is liberal.  ```\n",
