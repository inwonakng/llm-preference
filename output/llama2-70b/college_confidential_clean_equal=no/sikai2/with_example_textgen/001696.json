The highest GPA on Michigan\u2019s scale is 4.0. And Michigan\u2019s current acceptance rate roughy 20% and plummeting), not 29%. Also, the mid 50% ACT range for the latest class was 31-35 for Duke and 30-33 for Michigan. \"\"Duke ranked top 10 in USNews, WSJ, Forbes, USA Today and selectivity. Regular decision 6.3% acceptance rate. Clearly defined peer group of U Chicago, Brown, Columbia and Penn. based on statistics of matriculating class Michigan doesn\u2019t appear in the top 20 Or match Up as a peer. Wash U or Emory as Peers. Great school but not Duke.\"\" Those rankings are based on flawed data presented by private universities, including Duke. Duke lists its student to faculty ratio as 6:1. It is in fact 11:1 Those are the types of exaggerations that give private universities the edge in the rankings. If public universities played the same game (sadly, they cannot since their data is audited by the state), they too would be ranked much higher. But among the educated, Michigan and Duke are peers. That is certainly the opinion of academe, which generally assigns identical undergraduate education ratings to Michigan and Duke. Also, the OP is interested in Engineering, and in Engineering, it is Michigan that is usually ranked higher than Duke. \u201cUS. News ranks Duke # 11 in counselors rank Vs Mich at #22 and over all Duk #9 Vs Michigan #28\u201d You mention high school counselors  but not university presidents and provosts. Why is that?   According to university presidents and provosts, Michigan and Duke are tied at #13. This actually supports my point above, that Michigan and Duke are considered peer institutions among the highly educated. \"\"The Duke name cari\u00ebs more cache in the finance space buy a Wide margin. I base this on thirty years of experience. Duke kids are nethodically recruited by NY IB shops and benefit from the depth and breath of there alumni network. Michigan has not been a target of any of the three major banks i have worked For. Occasionaly a resum\u00e9 would Pass my desk but limited if any true support.\"\" The OP has not indicated an interest in Wall Street. As an engineer, I assume he is more concerned with Silicon Valley and tech industry jobs. If that is the case, Duke does not present an advantage over Michigan, and I certainly don\u2019t see why the opinion of Investment Banks should be a factor in the OP\u2019s decision. That being said, I am surprised that Michigan was not a target at any of the major banks that you have worked for. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hired 35 undergraduate students from Ross alone last year. They also took 40 interns from Ross. Other major IBanks like BoA, Blackstone, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche, Lazard, Paribas, UBS etc\u2026all hired Ross students as well. IBanks also recruit graduates from the CoE (Goldman Sachs hired 16 CoE graduates last year alone) and LSA, but obviously focus most of their attention on Ross. Clearly, Ross is a target, whether you care to admit it or not. https://michiganross.umich.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/2016_employment_report.pdf   (pages 9 and 41) \u201cDuke has a better reputation, is harder to get into and is more heavily recruited from.\u201d Duke is harder to get into, but it does not have a better reputation where it matters, and it is not more heavily recruited. \u201cSaying otherwise is purely an attempt to minimize a well defined hierarchical difference.\u201d I am speechless.  ```\n",
