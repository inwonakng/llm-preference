Unless you really want to go for a PhD, going full time to grad school for an MS doesn\u2019t really pay unless you are an International looking for visa status.  Many companies will hire you with your BS and subsidize you going part time for an MS while you work.  So the school comparison (for this major) should be done on the basis of the undergrad degree. In this case, cost-wise Michigan is the clear winner. When it comes to fit, the schools have very different vibes to them and being in NYC might have extra appeal.  ```\n",
