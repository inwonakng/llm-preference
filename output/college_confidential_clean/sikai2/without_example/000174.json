What is your financial aid package at each of the schools? How will you afford a $30,000 a year school? And how will your family be able to make ends meet with you off at college, and not able to work much? Penn State offers some students the summer start where they can get 6 credits of classes done before the fall semester starts. It is not free, there will be extra costs. I agree, for your situation, it makes more sense to work as much as possible this summer. Pitt is a fine school. Do you have a Pitt or Penn State branch nearby, where you could commute to for the first two years? That would save money.  ```\n",
