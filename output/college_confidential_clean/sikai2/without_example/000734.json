If not needed, then OP has $184,000 plus interest benefit for earning a top finance degree. P.S. I agree that if OP does not pursue finance or information systems  or international business (Penn\u2013Wharton #5 & NYU\u2013Stern #9) at NYU Stern, then OP needs a plan & a reevaluation. But as presented, NYU is the better choice at such a significant discount.  ```\n",
