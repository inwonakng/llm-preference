In nearly all instances  But for medical school applications many top med schools love the stars coming out of state flagships. If the kid is this bright, I would be surprised if they weren\u2019t uber elite at their flagship and get into the better med school. I think top undergrad school Yale coupled with inexpensive but good med school is less valuable long term tha. UW coupled with a top 15 med school. When discussing your dr do you mention wher they went undergrad or med school. For me it may not even come up where they ent undergrad. But it\u2019s no mistake going to Yale of course. It\u2019s Yale. And for all the obvious reasons. But I do believe that people underestimate the quality of education and guidance available at a school like UW. I would go to Yale myself. But I\u2019m not writing the checks So it\u2019s  easy for me to say.  ```\n",
