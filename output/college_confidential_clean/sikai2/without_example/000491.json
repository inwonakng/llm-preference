It is wonderful that your daughter found a match school. But other posters\u2019 experiences matter as well. In short, Kenyon\u2013a very small rural Ohio LAC with a heavy drinking culture and lack of diversity\u2013is not for everyone. It is noteworthy that, according to your prior posts, that your daughter wanted to major in English which is Kenyon\u2019s strength. If I had to sum up my impression of Kenyon College, I see it as very similar to many New England prep boarding schools. Very similar. P.S. The only reason that I responded to your post is my reaction to your first paragraph which suggests that only you have a true insight with respect to Kenyon College. I have been aware of & familiar with Kenyon for over 4 decades now & two of my best friends in life are graduates of Kenyon (both teach at prep schools). Some people are more perceptive than others & some people are clear on their preferences, likes & dislikes. In sort, everyone\u2019s opinion should be respected & valued in this thread.  ```\n",
