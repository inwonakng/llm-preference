Just take a look at their student outcomes\u2014- high retention rates after freshman year, newer state of the art facilities \u2014- near 100% employment or grad school after graduation plus average starting salarys for each engineering discipline in the high 60k\u2019s to over 70k for computer and electrical engineering. Contrast that with out of state public school costs or what I call the \u201cStevens Dilemma\u201d where a school like Stevens gives huge scholarship discounts to freshmen who fail to pull a 3.0 and thereafter lose that mo ru.  ```\n",
