This student lacks that one big thing you can point at, so no Olympic medal or Rhodes Scholarship, for example. Is the outcome college dependent? I don\u2019t know. Every talented kid is a bit different. What they need to thrive is different. We never really know about the road not taken. Again, I would choose Michigan based on the information presented. It is a great school. My point is simply that for certain particular exceptional students, who see MIT as a better fit, I can imagine a situation where MIT could be worth it if it. I have no reason to believe that is true for the OP of this thread though.  ```\n",
