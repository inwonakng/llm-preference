But a few things were clear: OP\u2019s family is in 250K+ range (that\u2019s MIT full pay threshold) and OP would choose MIT if there were no price differential. If OP is offered MIT EA and UM full ride he is such a high achiever that he is likely to have a mid career income 300K+ twenty years from now. For a person having a future earning $250k+/yr for 25+ years a $250k difference does not look so big. As @Much2learn suggested people who think MIT new grad being offered more than $200k total compension is out of the norm are probably out of touch with today\u2019s job market. I know a few MIT kids who have received multi-million dollar funding from VCs while still in college.  There are possibilities that MIT undergrad experience may offer but they hardly exist at UM.  ```\n",
