With curriculum on-line for most school programs and things like \u201crate my professor\u201d and tons other social media, kids that have a good idea of what they want to study can often plot out 50% or more of the courses they are going to take, even going so far as IDing some of the profs they\u2019d like to study with, or alternatively IDing the profs they want to avoid (One of my kids, for instance, was really insterested in a fairly specific minor where 50% of the required courses are taught by the same prof. I made them email a bunch of current students to make sure the teacher was someone they wanted to spend 6 courses with.)  ```\n",
