    "user_input": "College A: ```Bates College```\nCollege B: ```Hamilton College```\nComment: ```Hmmm, interesting, @wisteria100 . I don\u2019t think of Hamilton as being more creative than Bates. In fact, I am impressed with how strong the arts do seem to be at Bates. There\u2019s an actual Art museum on campus. But, you know my preferences, of course:-) Bates is unquestionably liberal. I would not describe it as activist. My daughter likes that. There was a \u201cget out the vote\u201d effort during the election. I know people did attend the Women\u2019s March in various cities. But no, not activist. My D thought Hamilton was preppy and that was a reason she decided not to apply there. There are preppy kids at Bates too, but I would describe most of the stduent body as leaning a little more urban, or a little more outdoorsy, mixed with geeks, athletes, and hippies. (D\u2019s roommate is a total hippy.) Last year, Bates admitted 40 first-gen to college students. It works hard to increase diversity. That is one of the reasons why it went test-optional decades ago. Great question about non-athletes, @hopeful1660 . D has found them, no problem. She has been with several groups of people from the start, and has now definitely found her people. None are athletes, though a couple of them are into ultimate Frisbee, which is apparently pretty popular. She seems to now have an ever-expanding group of non-athlete friends. The college puts on fairly regular campus-wide events and everyone comes and everyone enjoys them. There is partying. Bates made Princeton Review\u2019s list again for Beer drinking. My D says she doesn\u2019t know why. She isn\u2019t a big partier, and though parties happen, it\u2019s not in your face. Or maybe she is hanging out with the wrong people! I seem to recall that she did say the lacrosse team has a lot of parties. Maybe the atheltes take the place of Greek Life? I am not sure about your concern for the reputation. I would say that Bates and Hamilton are both highly regarded. They have nearly identical acceptance rates. I cannot imagine that any employer would ever consider one better than the other. Bates has a very active alumni network. There are many internships and jobs offered by Bates alumni. The new president, Clayton Spencer, has raised over $120 million for the college in just four years. It has beautifully modernized buildings, and some gorgeous brand new dorms that are a thousand times nicer than the ones I saw at Hamilton, but perhaps Hamilton\u2019s dorms have been spruced up. There is, as far as I know, only one from that isn\u2019t gorgeous, but even it was given a facelift last summer. It at least has large rooms. I do not think Bates\u2019 endowment is an issue at all. Not sure if you have visited yet, but the campus and its buildings are beautiful. Bates does have another big advantage, and that is its proximity to civilization. The college puts on free shuttles regularly to Freeport, which is a fun town with AMAZING shopping and restaurants. You will regularly run into kids from Bowdoin and Colby there. Also, free shuttles to Portland, which is a very cool small city. Once or twice a month, you can go to Boston for $20 for,the whole day. It\u2019s only two hours away. Lewsiton is a modest town, but there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance and the kids go out. The countryside is very beautiful there, and there is a lovely wide river where the rowing team practices. Next to campus is a bird sanctuary where kids run, and it appears, have bonfires. So you can tell I think it\u2019s a great school. The retention rates between the two are very similar. You can\u2019t go wrong with either, but after reading what you are looking for, you seem like a Bobcat to me:-)  ```\n",
