Apart from that:  [quote] I do believe the Parchment data, where the split is 58%-42% in favor of Yale (although the split is not statistically significant according to parchment). [/quote]  This is inaccurate; according to Parchment, at a 95% confidence level, Yale gets between 67% and 49%. The rest of that paragraph is speculation. In any case, I\u2019m certainly not \u201cdistorting [your] words\u201d, just observing that some cross-admits undoubtedly choose Penn for Wharton, since Yale doesn\u2019t have an undergraduate business major. Finally, there\u2019s no major difference on bioengineering or on medical schools, where both Penn and Yale are top-ten. If you\u2019re going to hang everything on rankings, it looks like a lot of Penn and Yale grads didn\u2019t get the memo that they should have gone to Georgia Tech or UCSD for bioengineering.  ```\n"
