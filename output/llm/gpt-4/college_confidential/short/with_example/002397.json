I\u2019ll add that to say Middlebury has the most serious outdoor kids of the three schools makes little sense based on my observations.  I know that my son chose Bowdoin, in part, because of it\u2019s tremendous Outing Club and the school\u2019s emphasis on exploring nature.  It transformed his life.  Today he teaches, and lives, the outdoor adventure world (along with his day job of teaching biology) as do many of his Bowdoin friends now scattered about the planet combining education with the outdoors.  I\u2019ve no doubt Middlebury is similar, and have less connection with Bates.  You\u2019re correct in suggesting that Bowdoin is unique in it\u2019s balance for those who may not be interested in the outdoors\u2026It\u2019s a school set in beautiful Brunswick and attracts a wide range of students from all cultures.  ```\n"
