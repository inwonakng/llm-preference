Some of those kids who score higher also might not be great test-takers. So if we have a kid with a 32 and a kid with a 30\u2026 maybe neither one is great at standardized tests. We probably shouldn\u2019t assume it\u2019s only the kid with the lower score who has issues with tests. Proving intelligence in one person isn\u2019t easy. Proving the difference between two or more people\u2026 ugh. hehe  ```\n"
