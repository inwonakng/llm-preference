The Stamps Scholarship is a highly coveted award, speaks volumes in and of itself, and creates an entire additional network. https://www.stampsfoundation.org/2018/02/08/introducing-stamps-scholars-connect/ FWIW, there are plenty of young people out there who are quite successful without having attended HYPMS. They may even work or attend grad school right alongside MIT grads with their lowly state school degree (of which UM does not even qualify since it is a powerhouse U.)  MIT grads aren\u2019t like people on TV commercials walking around with a golden glow bc of their UG degree.     And the MIT degree does not guarantee automatic business success or grad school admissions.  The person behind the degree matters, and a student who qualified as a Stamps Scholar has demonstrated significant accomplishments already. As a high school student, your perspective is limited to what you hear from others that you believe. I hope the OP of this thread is in dialogue with his parents, not his peers, and that they ignore everything except what is best for their personal situation. This young person faces a win-win decision. There is no bad answer (unless the $250,000 does financially hurt his parents.)  ```\n"
