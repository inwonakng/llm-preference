I avoid placing colleges within any hiercharchy (and don\u2019t understand what the number ten has to do with anything), but prefer to appreciate them for their singular attributes, where they exist. Bates: Admirally founded by early abolitionists under severe regional opposition. Current administration seems committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming environment for all students. Compact campus on the edge of Lewiston. Hamilton: Benefits from the curricular, architectural, spatial and, to some extent, cultural legacy of having been two colleges of different characteristics and attributes. A balanced curriculum, but also a writers\u2019 college. Former fraternity houses are now beautiful residence halls.  ```\n"
