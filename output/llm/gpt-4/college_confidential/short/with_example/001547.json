The answer is different for every family, there is no clear answer.  My short answer above is based on what OP posted - parents could afford to pay their share and OP would come out with 60K loans.  I know so many students who have changed their mind about medical school. My daughter was offered a full tuition at a 2nd tier LAC.  I also had a hard time to walk away from 40K/yr back then, but It was my daughter who said she would be willing to borrow 10k/yr from me to go to an Ivy.  I also thought about what we could do with 200K.  I decided the ROI on my D could be much higher than if I\u2019ve put it in any other investment. There is a discussion on the Parent Forum about if it matters what school your kid goes to, maybe it is worth a read.  From my personal experience, it does matter and it matters more than just the first job.  My older daughter is making top 1% salary at an age of 27 and my younger daughter is finishing up a 2 year internship where they only hired from Ivies and Stanford.  I think her internship helped her greatly in getting into a top 4-5 law school.  We are again at a crossroad of be a full pay at that top law school or take the scholarship from a lower ranking law school.  A very good friend of D2 was just offered an assistant editor job at a major newspaper.  He also went to a top ranking school.  The competition was fierce because the job paid over 70K with benefits.  They had a lot of applicants and they had to use some filters to limit number of people they wanted to interview. If your parents are liquidating their 401K or emptying out all of their savings acct to pay for Yale then your family can\u2019t afford it.  On the other hand, if your parents had put away money and planned on paying for your college (maybe in state), then I wouldn\u2019t miss out on the opportunity of going to Yale.  I am in no way saying one couldn\u2019t get a very good education from UW, but it is different than what you would get Yale.  You need to make a decision as to what it is worth to you (family).  ```\n"
