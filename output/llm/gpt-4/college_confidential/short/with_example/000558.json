All the advices above are really good. With the med school admissions move to competency based admissions, more weight are going to be put on activities outside classroom. If the student is \u201con the bubble\u201d academically, less time for that student can be put on activities outside classroom. Not to mention the possible anxiety which might come with that uncertainty. Personally I think \u201cjust build confidence as a freshman by taking it easy\u201d is a huge mistake. Students should take a mix of difficult and not-so-difficult courses to test the water. Sooner or later those \u201cdifficult\u201d courses are going to come. It is better to know if it is feasible to achieve the above-the-threshold GPA as soon as possible. \u201cOn the bubble\u201d is the worst scenario.  Adding a more difficult major like computer science/etc.as a backup probably makes things worse. If the student can\u2019t even handle the premed courses without other hard/time-consuming courses, what are the chances that the students would be able to handle both? Plus different majors have totally different internships. There is no one-size-fit-all answer to OP\u2019s question. OP is smart enough to think about this. I agree with @Creekland 's statement 100% \u201cWhen kids from my school are hoping to go to med school and ask for my advice it\u2019s simple. Look for an affordable school you like where you\u2019re in the Top 25% of entering stats\u201d. It is not good to play tennis in a league full of people like Novak Djokovic if one can\u2019t play tennis at that level. OP should view the course material as its competitor, not its classmates. Yes, at this level, the material is much more advanced. We have reviewed and written some solutions for Orgo exams recently. It is definitely not easy. A high level of understanding of the material is required to answer the questions correctly. (We actually get 2.5 points since we found out TA graded one question wrong \u2014 this is the joke \u2026 we gained 2.5 points but we weren\u2019t even there.  ) OP should strive to learn the material at a high level in a school at this level. Otherwise, OP should look for other schools with lower standards.  ```\n"
