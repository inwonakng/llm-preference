OP, the only thing that\u2019s tugging at you is the brand name of Yale.  Funny thing about college choice: it is both a significant but a not-so-really life-altering decision as people think.  The decision about where to attend seems bigger than it really is.  For instance, many, many students wish they could be in your shoes and attend Madison. Another issue, and I hope this isn\u2019t too personal.  But if you are expected to pay full freight at Yale, this means that your family is full pay.  I understand that some full pay families are right on the bubble, expected to cover the complete COA even though a family might feel that this is beyond their means.  However, if I am reading things right, your family is willing to pay 220K towards your Yale education, and you are expected to handle the remaining 60K? Question: why aren\u2019t you or your parents suggesting what strikes me as the obvious?  \u201cSon (or dear daughter), you will attend UW-Madison, and we will finance your medical school costs up to 220K.\u201d  In other words, if medical school is in your future, why spend so much of everyone\u2019s money (yours (in the form of future debt) and your parents\u2019) on undergrad?  Am I missing something? If your family could comfortably afford Yale, that would be different.  If the debt were lower (let\u2019s say 30K, which many students do take on; debt is the reality for most college students), maybe that would change things, too (even though I don\u2019t think Yale is worth 30K in debt, not when the other option is practically free).  I wish you the best, though.  ```\n"
