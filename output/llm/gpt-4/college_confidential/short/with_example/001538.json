That is a general question I have for state flagships and the top 15. UW 75% 1450 SAT Yale 75% 1600 Yale 25% 1420 Without more data points,  it is hard to tell exactly, but you could interpolate and get close. I envision two overlapping bell curves with Yale\u2019s shifted and elongated to the right. Anecdotally: The only kid who got into Yale from our HS in the past 7 years had a 1420 (Naviance makes it easy to figure this out). He had a 4.0 as do pretty much the top 10% of the class (my kid said he was very smart). FWIW, he had the \u201cmother of all\u201d non-sports ECs for Yale. His EC was off the charts for a high school kid. I have no doubt he could throw down a big GPA in either place.  ```\n"
