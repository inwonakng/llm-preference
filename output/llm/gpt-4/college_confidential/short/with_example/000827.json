This seems to come up every time Brown is mentioned \u2013 but I don\u2019t think the people who spread that misinformation have much recent experience with Brown themselves. [/quote]  There\u2019s no need for anyone to speculate either way, as Brown publishes its grade distributions. The 2016-17 data is below. The total percentage of C\u2019s and NC\u2019s awarded in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences ranges from 3% (humanities) to 9% (physical sciences) \u2013 low percentages however one parses the data. Humanities A: 49% (slightly down from 51% in 2007-08) S: 38% (up from 30% in 2007-08) B: 10% (down from 16% in 2007-08) NC: 2% (same as 2007-08) C: 1% (same as 2007-08) Social Sciences A: 60% (up from 52% in 2007-08) S: 19% (down from 26% in 2007-08) B: 17% (slightly up from 15% in 2007-08) C: 2% (down from 5% in 2007-08) NC: 2% (same as 2007-08) Life Sciences A: 62% (up from 54% in 2007-08) B: 21% (slightly down from 25% in 2007-08) S: 12% (same as 2007-08) C: 4% (slightly down from 6% in 2007-08) NC: 2% (same as 2007-08) Physical Sciences A: 52% (slightly up from 49% in 2007-08) B: 22% (slightly down from 26% in 2007-08) S: 16% (slightly up from 14% in 2007-08) C: 5% (slightly down from 7% in 2007-08) NC: 4% (slightly down from 5% in 2007-08)  ```\n"
