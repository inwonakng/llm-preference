I\u2019m a 2016 Pomona grad, so I can give you some specific, current insights. All of the fields you are interested in are excellent at Pomona, and a liberal arts college and community can be a particularly stimulating way to explore numerous disciplines and connect readily with people across different interests. It sounds like your long-term goal is a career within computer science. Here\u2019s a look at the pros and cons of Pomona\u2019s CS at present: Pros:  The community of students, faculty, and alumni is exceptional. People look out for one another and are encouraging, supportive, and kind. Your feedback is taken seriously and whenever you need help or advising, there is a lot of receptiveness to that.   Prepares you well academically for graduate school. Pomona is one of the top feeder schools on a per capita basis to computer science PhD programs. In fact, many people who are presently at grad school have told me the teaching and individual attention is clearly far above that of the major university they are a part of (in their own classes and in their TA capacities for undergrads there).  Excellent outcomes. Whether you want to go to a reputable graduate program or top notch industry job, Pomona will help you get there. I've never heard of anyone having difficulty on this regard. The Claremont Colleges are collectively seen as a target school by many tech companies, and ample on-campus recruiting and interviews make it easy to land a job or internship. Many of my friends leave with six figure salaries straight after graduation in many of the famous tech companies. For graduate school, I can't think of anyone who didn't end up at a top 10 program (MIT, Berkeley, Cornell, etc). Pomona is also one of the top schools for students getting STEM fellowships like the NSF, Goldwater, Churchill, etc. Easy to engage with research and get funding for internships, independent projects, conferences, etc. This is just true for Pomona in general- there is a lot of money and programs designed to help students fund whatever they are passionate about. Harvey Mudd has a 5 college summer computer science research program as well.   Mixed:  Doing internships in LA. There are a surprising number of tech companies within the metro area, so theoretically, that would enable students to gain other experiences during the year. Most of them are in West LA/Santa Monica, however, which is quite far from Claremont (50 miles or so). Public transportation will take you 2.5 hours each way, so it\u2019s pretty necessary to have a car. But then you have to deal with LA traffic. There are a couple of tech experiences a bit closer- Pasadena, Downtown LA, USC Innovation Lab. Getting to DTLA from Claremont via public transportation is pretty straightforward.  Cons:  Classes are not as small as they are in other departments of the college. Pomona\u2019s average class size is 15, but it is difficult to find a CS class with fewer than 25 students. That said, almost none tend to be over 50 either, and even in larger classes professors take the time to know the students individually.   Lots of interest, but not the most ideal set-up to accommodate it. Getting into CS classes is tough if you're a non-major (they advise students to declare immediately upon arriving). If you're a CS major, you'll definitely have priority in order to graduate with the degree within four years, but many popular electives can be locked out. Pomona did just hire 2 more full time faculty, so hopefully that helps a bit. Mudd is presently in their own crisis for CS and honestly, there's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen. I think you can count on Mudd if you want to do research with a professor there, but if you want to get into a specific course, it's probably going to be a lottery (for them and for us).  The emphasis is pretty theoretical and isn't the sort of pre-professional, project based work that you would want to present to someone in the industry. Students and liaisons step in to cover that aspect (hackathons, student led teaching, collaborative service-based projects, etc), but the department itself is very academic. One way to alleviate this is to do Harvey Mudd's Computer Science Clinic, in which you do an industry-based project as your senior thesis. It's open to CS students regardless of home school. Most students will intern in their summers while doing research during the school year at Pomona, allowing them to be prepared both for academia and for the industry.  Smaller course selection within CS- at the end of the day, most of your experiences will be coming from Pomona, and it's a small school with just 1600 students and 240 professors in total.   === You mentioned Johns Hopkins\u2019s stronger alumni network. I have a close friend at JHU, and that\u2019s actually one of her biggest complaints with the school. She said that it can be difficult as an undergrad to benefit from alumni experiences. All of the various constituent colleges like Bloomberg, Med School, etc. have independent identities. I think what you\u2019re referring to is that JHU is a larger school, so the alumni reach is much bigger. But in terms of actually connecting to alums and being advised from them, I feel like a small LAC like Pomona fosters a special dynamic to give back. Forbes says that 31% of Pomona grads donate, ranking it #25 for \u201cMost Grateful Grads\u201d, while JHU is 13% and ranks #48. I\u2019ve seen a lot of my CS classmates come back to Pomona to seek out interns for the companies they\u2019re working at, and there\u2019s also a larger network of 5C alums eager to support one another! So you\u2019re not only looking at people from Pomona, but from Mudd, Scripps, Pitzer, and CMC as well who you can reach out to. That said, JHU is definitely more well-known, and is a world-class research university. I believe their philosophy department was just given a $75 million dollar gift. And it seems you\u2019ve identified specific facilities that excite you. So I can see the dilemma. Obviously, I\u2019d pick Pomona, but I\u2019m biased. But I think if you\u2019re confident about graduate school, Pomona can help launch you to the best ones out there (and the top facilities involved with them) while giving you a transformative, once in a lifetime liberal arts college experience. Pomona is known for its rigorous academics coupled with a high quality of life & happy students. The Claremont Colleges really enrich the experience and help the school feel larger and more exciting. I\u2019m looking at a website of ratings based on student reviews, and out of 10 (the maximum): Johns Hopkins vs Pomona- Education Quality: 8.4 vs 8.8 Individual Focus: 6.6 vs 9.1 Collaboration: 6.6 vs 8.9 Friendliness: 7.4 vs 9.2 Faculty Accessibility: 7.3 vs 9.3 Social Life: 6.0 vs 7.5 Scholastic Success: 7.7 vs 8.9 Extracurricular Activities: 7.0 vs 8.0 University Resources: 7.3 vs 8.5 On another website: Overall Experience at Pomona- 4.65/5 Overall Experience at Johns Hopkins- 4.04/5 It seems that students are more content at Pomona  Good luck with your decision- there are pros and cons to both. They\u2019re almost opposites of each other to an extent, but you\u2019re sure to have a great experience either way!  ```\n"
