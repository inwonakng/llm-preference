I think you can succeed anywhere, and both schools have good premed opportunities. Northwestern might have better sports if thats your gig. Rice does have the reputation of \u201cHappiest Students\u201d which is crucial for your success! (I would have gone to Rice of NU if only I didn\u2019t get rejected lol) Rice also may have more inflation than NU, which can benefit you for premed. And if you want to go to Texas for med school (if your parents move or you get residency there) it is really cheap. Anyways, it is great to have such good options, and both schools have marginal differences. Hopefully you visited but if you didn\u2019t just try to choose by: cost, weather, location (since the academics are pretty much the same), semester vs quarter, residential colleges vs frats, etc\u2026 Good luck!!!  ```\n"
