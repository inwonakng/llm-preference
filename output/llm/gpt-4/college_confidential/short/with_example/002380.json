[/quote]  Amherst doesn\u2019t have EDII. Just ED and RD. It does have an excellent record with med school placement and very individualized med/health advising. It doesn\u2019t screen applicants for committee letters and supports all of them even if they don\u2019t make what it considers to be \u201clikely admit\u201d MCAT and GPAs. But the question of Canadian vs US med schools is definitely important to look into. If it will be really hard to get into a US Med school as a Canadian citizen, you may be better off applying to Canadian med schools and that might or might not mean applying from a Canadian undergrad. Many students who think they want to be pre-med change their minds, and not necessarily because it\u2019s \u201ctoo hard\u201d, but because they discover related careers that they didn\u2019t know about that require fewer years of education, pay well and are better fits. I\u2019ll also add that Amherst\u2019s recent study of its athletics program, just completed this year, found that few varsity athletes major in the sciences. As a pre-med you have something like 7 required science courses with labs, so this may be something to look at - can you make time for the work and the required labs and still compete on the team?  Some can and do, but fewer than non-athletes. https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/PlaceOfAthleticsAtAmherst_Secure_1.pdf  ```\n"
