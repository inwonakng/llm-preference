Students can take almost unlimited classes as satisfactory/no credit . The deadline to drop a class is at the last day of classes. Also with no distribution requirements, students are largely taking classes they are excited to be in, rather than to fulfill requirements. Brown only gives grades of A, B and C with no A- or B+, etc. so if a student doesn\u2019t get a 4.0 in the class, the next possible grade is a 3.0. So some students who are not getting As and in some cases, even Bs, will drop a class at the end of the semester rather than taking a grade that will substantially lower their GPA. Brown also does not give Ds and Fs. Any grade lower than a C and it\u2019s as if the class never existed on your transcript. The A-B-C grade system also sometimes result in the cutoff for an A being a little more generous than at a school where the next lowest grade is a 3.7 rather than a 3.0. but, there is a degree of grade deflation as well when the student with a 3.6-3.7 average in the class gets a B/3.0 as a final grade. GPA inflation is not the same thing as grade inflation in individual classes.  The quality and quantity of work that is required to get an A in a class at Brown is not at some lower level than its peer schools. Like many peer schools,   most classes  at Brown don\u2019t have a bell curve distribution for assigning grades, so if 60% of the students do A level work then 60% of the students will get As.  But students shouldn\u2019t choose Brown thinking  it\u2019s going to be a lot easier to get an A than somewhere else.  ```\n"
