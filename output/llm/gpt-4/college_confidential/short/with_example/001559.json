I went to one of the top NYC med school.  But coming out of an Ivy undergrad did open up a lot of doors for me for residency and post grad. However many of my colleagues are not from elite colleges, and very few people ask a doctor which undergrad they attended.  Most do care to ask which med school and post grad training.  So if your goal is to go to med school it going to Madison is fine as long as you study hard and get great grades.  Buy mediocre grades will certainly not help.  Once you get into med school, going to Yale as undergrad in the long run is only to build up your own self esteem.  ```\n"
