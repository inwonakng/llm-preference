There\u2019s little confusing these two schools\u2019 over-riding atmospheres. At the risk of stereotyping, Amherst is measurably more east coast pre-professional, Carleton measurably more intellectually individualistic. The Goodsell Observatory prank referenced earlier (http://www.citypages.com/news/carleton-students-love-r2-d2-so-much-they-turn-a-building-into-the-droid-6539523) is pure Carleton, rinse and repeat, not likely to be mistaken by anyone who knows these schools as a way to spend a night in Amherst. These difference are neither good nor bad, just differences. I\u2019ll support the call for the OPs son to search his heart as well as his mind in determining where he\u2019d most feel at home these coming four years.  ```\n"
