The fact is \u2013 there\u2019s now way to screw this up. Both spectacular choices. Carleton definitely has its strengths and is, by reputation, probably the best LAC in the entire Midwest. Amherst is maybe the best in the country or certainly among the top two or three. Purely on reputation, I\u2019d give Amherst a small but not insignificant edge. Also, keep in mind the Five College Consortium and those additional resources at hand with Amherst. But if Carleton is stronger in physics, then that\u2019s certainly reason enough to go there instead. Again, no wrong choices here. Good luck with your tough decision.  ```\n"
