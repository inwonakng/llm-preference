If you\u2019d strongly prefer being in the Boston area, the private school feel, and other pros for BC make it the much better choice, then spend the extra money. If they are tied or close to it, I\u2019d suggest UNC based on the savings. I think they are a wash academically and rep-wise for undergrad \u2013 and both are really solid in business \u2013 so either way, you should be fine academically.  ```\n"
