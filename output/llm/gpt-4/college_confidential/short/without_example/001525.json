Even if (that\u2019s a BIG \u201cif\u201d) you managed to get the private loans to pay for Harvard, the debt would sabotage your future.  You have to take out private loans to complete medical school.  With $80k or more in undergraduate, you\u2019d be turned down.  The last thing you want is to be a medical school dropout with $150k in student loan debt.  As long as you have top grades and a high MCAT score, it won\u2019t matter which school you graduate from.  It\u2019s hard to get into medical school either way.  ```\n"
