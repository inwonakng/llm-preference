I would say that Washu artsci does follow a \u201cliberal arts\u201d curriculum meaning that they place a heavy emphasis on well-roundedness being STEM or the humanities. I have a few friends doing polisci and are interning at various congressional offices so if you\u2019re looking to go into politics Washu is a great place for that. If your plan after undergrad is to go into grad school, Washu is also very good as Washu has really great name recognition in academia and I have heard good things about grad school placements from all majors. Feel free to dm me with any further questions. If I can\u2019t answer them, I can try to ask some friends.  ```\n"
