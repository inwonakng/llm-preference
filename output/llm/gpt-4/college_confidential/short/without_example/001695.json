Michigan hasn\u2019t released their acceptance rate for the Class of 2022, but for the Class of 2021 it was 26.5%. Not 29%. Now, if you assume applications increased to 65,000-70,000, from 60,000 last year, then the acceptance rate will drop to roughly 23-24%. Assuming the same number of acceptances as last year of course, but I\u2019ve heard that Michigan was planning on a smaller freshman class.  ```\n"
