Pitt does have a new financial aid program for students who are Pell grant eligible, in that they will match the Pell grant (see link below).  What is your family\u2019s EFC?  Did you file the FAFSA and PHEAA state grant forms?   Are your parents low income or just unwilling/unable to pay anything?  I would suggest applying to some of the PASSHE (true state) universities that have accredited business schools (West Chester, IUP, Bloomsburg, Clarion, Shippensburg), though even those schools will be a financial reach without some family support.  If your family is low income, you also might get better financial aid at a private college, of which Pennsylvania has many. https://www.affordable.pitt.edu/  ```\n"
