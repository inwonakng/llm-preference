In life / medical sciences, engineering and entrepreneurship, Penn wins over Yale.  The combination of its top five medical school, Wharton resources and courses and top engineering school are top of the line.  UChicago has no engineering and its life sciences/ medical school are its relative weak spot. UChicago is not in the conversation for these subjects.  ```\n"
