It\u2019s also good news because it means there isn\u2019t a huge gap between what your parents want to contribute and what they\u2019re expected to contribute. Do apply to WCU as a financial safety, just in case (especially if CSS profile isn\u2019t as kind to your financial circumstances). Do this today. Apply to PHEAA as soon as you\u2019re done with the WCU app.  ```\n"
