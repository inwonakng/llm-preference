Anyway, have to agree with what others said - Princeton attracts a certain kind of person looking for a certain education, a.k.a., not much time spent on non-academics. Stanford freaking caters to Olympians and pro athletes.  I can\u2019t imagine any true athlete picking Princeton over Stanford purely for the athletic advantage. Having gone to an Ivy, I know that at my school (near Princeton LOL) had few West Coast kids and it was isolating as far as I could tell from a third person view.  ```\n"
