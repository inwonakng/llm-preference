Parchment says the kids like UVA (#23 ranked by student choices) more than UM (#26). And UM undergrad hasn\u2019t beaten UVA in USNWR in like 25 years. Wa-hoo-wa!!!\u201d You need to maybe stop with parchment and usnews (and other) rankings and maybe give better advice than look at the rankings for your decision.  In this case that would be a disservice, a serious one,  A CS major will be a fish out of water at Columbia but will be right at home at Michigan, access to labs, research, a technology culture that\u2019s not reflected in rankings.  ```\n"
