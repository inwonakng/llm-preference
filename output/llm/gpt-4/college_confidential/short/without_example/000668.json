I totally get why California students want to go there (cheap and high ranked and close to home) and they live with the cons - huge classes, impacted majors, geographically homogeneous student body, etc because it\u2019s highly ranked and cheap. At least at CMU, you are paying for a private school experience. Smaller classes, plenty of sections, geographically diversity, etc.  ```\n"
