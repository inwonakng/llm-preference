I was comparing the more quirky and irreverent student body of a place like Stanford, with a definite west cost vibe and lifestyle, and contrasting that with the more east coast, (in my opinion, somewhat more uptight) preppy vibe of a place like Princeton. This is what I said: \"\"Stanford has a very west coast feel \u2013 its student body is quirky and irreverent, every bit as accomplished as those of its peer schools, but a bit more laid back, IMO. My D would not have \u201c[appreciated] the \u2026 \u2018preppy\u2019 vibe.\u201d I cannot comment on the quarter vs. semester system and how that works with athletics, but quarters do move at a fast pace. I think that the frequent mid-terms are more of an issue for some of the STEM classes than for the humanities and social sciences, although there are no shortage of papers to write for the latter two areas of study. @sushiritto - To my mind, Stanford is hardly what I would consider an \u201curban\u201d campus. More suburban than urban, IMO. And Princeton is, indeed, a beautiful hamlet. Yale, Columbia, NYU, Northeastern, U.Chicago are urban. Stanford is sprawling and suburban, and I\u2019d hardly consider Palo Alto to be an urban metropolis, no matter how much building is going on there.  ```\n"
