I\u2019m sure both of them are fine, but since you can\u2019t afford Temple, it doesn\u2019t really matter.  You keep asking for opinions about schools that should have been taken off the list as soon as you realized they would be too expensive.  Choose from Nebraska, UNR, or one of your instate schools.  ```\n"
