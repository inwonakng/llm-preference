I do not think there is a measurable difference in outcomes. I would focus on social fit. I think the strong Greek presence at Duke compared to Brown is a distinguishing factor, as is the bigger-time sports. Brown\u2019s sports teams on balance are not strong, though some are obviously better than others. Brown is more like a LAC with its strong undergraduate focus (no law school, no business school). Brown students are known for being happy there.  ```\n"
