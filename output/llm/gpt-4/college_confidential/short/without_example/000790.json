I didn\u2019t know schools could deteriorate or improve so much tremendously in such a short time frame relative to others.  It is more absurd to treat the Forbes ranking as grounded in any semblance of truth. You can do a comparison of per capita CS alumni using LinkedIn at FANG for Jhu CS versus Pomona CS. It should be a telling insight.  ```\n"
