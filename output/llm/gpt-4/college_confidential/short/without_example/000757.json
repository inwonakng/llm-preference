That aside, if you actually took out that much debt it would be hard to repay even with a high paying job and it would create a massive amount of pressure to really flourish at Wharton. If it\u2019s the parents sacrificing their savings then it changes the dynamic because there\u2019s no longer a worst case scenario where you have a huge debt burden that you can\u2019t get rid of for years and years. Without knowing the financial situation of the family it\u2019s hard to know how big of a difference $184,000 is to them. Penn is generally okay with financial aid for those who need it. So If they\u2019re simply shortening their vacation a few days and traveling to Florida instead of Greece, it\u2019s probably worth it. Stern is good, Wharton is better.  ```\n"
