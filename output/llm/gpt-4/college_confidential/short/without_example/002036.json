And yes rank does matter - to an extent - I agree smu generally lags about 10-15 spots (has always been top 25 in business week) back of Mccombs.  That being said SMU has great recruiting and for post graduate like the other two, so I wouldn\u2019t discount it.  Whatever best fit will be most important.  ```\n"
