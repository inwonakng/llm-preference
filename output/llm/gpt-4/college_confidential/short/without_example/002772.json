They both offer an excellent education. One academic thing you should think about is the differing curricula of the schools: Hamilton with the open curriculum; Bates with the more traditional distribution requirements. Check out lists of majors and courses to see which school carries more things that interest you. Compare study abroad programs if that interests you. See what they are doing research-wise if you think you might like to get involved in research at some point. Other fit variables include their environments/settings \u2013 Maine vs. Upstate NY, Lewiston vs. Clinton); social vibe (the two sides of Hamilton, the students at both schools and their party and club scenes, Greek life since you mentioned its importance, etc.); and dorms and food. You do have to eat and sleep there for most of four years. And, obviously, cost is a variable.  ```\n"
