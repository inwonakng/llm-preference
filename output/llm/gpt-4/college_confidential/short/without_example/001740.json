Perhaps if she were choosing specific doctoral programs, maybe, but as an undergrad I think the resources will be functionally equivalent. Besides, even if they are a bit better, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re worth $250K plus interest. Particularly if they are an engineering major, as other people here who hire engineers have repeatedly said that engineers don\u2019t get paid more for what college they went to. If OP is trying to raise venture capital in 10 years I doubt whether they went to MIT or Michigan will be the linchpin in their pitch. It\u2019ll be about their work experience, the networks they\u2019ve built and the idea they have. I work in tech, and I gotta say I know a LOT more Michigan alumni than I know MIT alumni.  ```\n"
