That is directly or indirectly (or both\u2026) responsible for them being ranked #1 for undergrad by USNews. Grads show the love by donating. Stanford is better known (and ranked) internationally due to its grad/PhD-level greatness, but you aren\u2019t getting your MBA (P\u2019ton doesn\u2019t have a B school\u2026), JD or PhD \u2013 you\u2019re getting your BA or BS. For that, no university is better than Princeton. If you were interested in Engineering or CS, Stanford has the edge. But Princeton is solid in those things and great at about everything else, and where curriculum is even, Princeton has the edge given the close interaction with your profs. Princeton\u2019s reputational bread is buttered by its undergrads and undergraduate emphasis, and that drives the budgeting and decision-making of the school. The undergrads are #1 there \u2013 they have to be, since they comprise nearly 70% of the total student population. Motivation and capacity (largest per-student endowment) equal performance. Regardless of your choice, you\u2019ll be at a great school.  ```\n"
