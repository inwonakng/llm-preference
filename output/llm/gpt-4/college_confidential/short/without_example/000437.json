Certain firms & companies feed more employees into M-7 MBA programs than others. So, for a variety of reasons, post undergraduate placement is important. Because of Atlanta\u2019s significance in the business world, great opportunities are available in Georgia. Because of IU-Kelley\u2019s reputation, standards, programs & size, great opportunities are available from IU-Kelley. And, yes, I understand that you are not in the MBA program at either school, but you can benefit from a strong MBA program as an undergraduate business major in a variety of ways.  ```\n"
