First, it should be clear that I worked backwards from known numbers of matriculated students (e.g., athletes, legacies, Asians) to figure out how HYPSM ended up with those numbers. What I\u2019m not saying is that these schools decide, for example, how many Asians they want, make a list of Asian applicants and then pick out names until they get to the quota. Admissions is holistic, and candidates may check multiple boxes (this, for example, is why I believe academically elite URMs, or highly-qualified development-level legacies face significantly better odds than applicants with a single hook). I think there may be some tweaking of the final list of admits before release to keep numbers \u201cbalanced\u201d, but I think it starts by picking kids that are holistically, and collectively, the best mix for the school\u2019s needs. Second, and related to the above, I\u2019m conscious that I haven\u2019t allowed for admits who fit in multiple categories. It would have been too complicated and speculative to try to adjust for that. I don\u2019t want to give the impression, though, that I don\u2019t believe anyone in my \u201cunquestionable genius\u201d category is URM or ORM, for example (I\u2019m sure plenty are), or that all international admits are either Asian or institutional priorities. The groups are presented without overlap to keep things simple.  ```\n"
