You said temple was $33000 a year.  You say you appealed and Temple gifted you more aid as an OOS student making it equal in price to Nebraska.  Are you telling us that Temple handed you, an OOS student another $13000 A YEAR for a total of $52,000??  Sorry, I find this really hard to believe.  Clearly this thread is just going to keep going around in circles until someone tells you what you want to hear which is go to Temple.  So here it is.  Go to Temple.  ```\n"
