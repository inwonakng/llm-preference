I did Wharton undergrad (M&T) and then got my MBA at NYU (part-time while employeed).  For what it\u2019s worth, I definitely felt that the Wharton undergrad classes were more advanced (and harder) than the Stern classes.  This could be an undergrad / grad difference, but the caliber of students at Wharton was higher than at Stern.  ```\n"
