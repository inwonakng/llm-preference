Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```@helpless2017 If your goal is to publish research, then GT is your school, not Olin.  Olin students have research internships, often with faculty members.  But I don\u2019t think their work will result in their names on the research publication.  Olin\u2019s emphasis is on practical hands on engineering and problem solving, not research.  If it\u2019s research you want, then you want to go to a research university, which GT definitely is. Olin is a teaching college, not a research college.  ```\n"
