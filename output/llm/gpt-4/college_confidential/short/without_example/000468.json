Georgia will get the likes of Coca-Cola, Sunburst, and local companies, which is fine.  IU is more nationally recognized is all I\u2019m saying.  if it were my kid it would be IU hands down.  Outside of Ivy League and the likes of Wash U and Carnegie Mellon, Indiana ranks among the top B schools in the country, consistently top 15.  ```\n"
