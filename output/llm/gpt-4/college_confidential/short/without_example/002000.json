We\u2019ve already established that global rankings can be pretty misleading. Refer to previous posts about Iowa, BU, and Minnesota being ranked over Dartmouth, Brown and Vanderbilt. Berkeley is not in the same class as elite private universities when it comes to the overall quality of the student body. That is just a fact (look at the standardized test scores). I\u2019m not trying to say that the best students are Berkeley are not excellent. The quality is just less uniform. Also, as the UC system is becoming very reliant on international students who pay significantly more than in-state students. Many of these internationals are viewed as sources of funding. They do not necessarily have the credentials to be admitted to a school like Berkeley. Duke is need-blind for all its applicants. That makes a tremendous difference.  ```\n"
