It\u2019s all in the company you keep. [/quote]  I think it\u2019s safe to say that all strong schools, URoch, Emory, Tulane, USC, Tufts, etc, are the \u201csafe\u201d schools for Ivy Hopefuls.  (To be clear, none of those schools are actually safeties).  That\u2019s why they\u2019re all loaded with top students as well. Reported admission rates to med school are NOT comparable .  Not everyone is using the same measures.  Some are only reporting their MD admissions.  Some are including MD and DO admissions.  Some are also including admissions to foreign med schools. Virtually all good schools report high acceptance rates for their applicants who have a 3.5+ GPA and a 510+ MCAT.  ```\n"
