It doesn\u2019t matter what our backgrounds are. The opinions are the same.\u201d The value of the advice isn\u2019t.  A junior in HS could still advise you for a plan of treatment for a mysterious ailment, but you probably wouldn\u2019t take his advice over someone who went to med school.  Yet only their backgrounds differ. \u201cNo one knows what you paid or if you won a scholarship or not.\u201d Uh, you do realize that hiring managers read resumes, no?  Have you ever read a resume? \u201cPerception and reputation open more doors than many people may every realize unless they attend one of the top programs.\u201d And that\u2019s why I asked about your background.  A ton of people on this thread actually have attended top programs.  I\u2019d like to know on what basis you\u2019re making the assertion that \u201cperception and reputation open more doors than many people may every realize\u201d considering that many of the people on this thread, as I mentioned, did attend top programs.  ```\n"
