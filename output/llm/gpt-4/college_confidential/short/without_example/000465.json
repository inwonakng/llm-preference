You seem to think there is a much more studious atmosphere at Kelley and that honors college students don\u2019t party. Allow me to disabuse you of those ideas. Kelley students and IU students in general party hard, including those in honors. McNutt (where the Kelley LLC used to be located) is party central. UGA is the same. Most schools are the same. The OP can have fun at both schools and receive an excellent business education. They aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. By choosing UGA, the OP isn\u2019t saying he/she is any less academic/studious or career-focused or motivated. Step away from the rankings.  ```\n"
