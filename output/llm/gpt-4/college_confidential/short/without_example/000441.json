The average starting salary & signing bonus in 2017 shows a significant difference between the two schools. IU-Kelley MBA grads started at an average of $120,649 while UGA-Terry MBAs started at a much lower $100,200 despite being within 75-90 minutes of Atlanta. And, yes, this is MBA, not undergraduate business numbers. You should be able to get placement & internship info. from each respective undergraduate business school.  ```\n"
