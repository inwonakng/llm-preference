Sorry about posting away questions on your thread.   can you please let me know if you filled out a FAFSA form for Banneker Key scholarship?   Does UMD have supplemental essays? D says she could not find it on coalition app or on their website. Does UMD have any supplemental essays or honors essays?   for one of the scholarships (not Banneker Key), the website says they will consider following \u201cacademic achievement, extracurricular activities, awards, honors, and an essay.\u201d https://admissions.umd.edu/finance/freshman-merit-scholarships   can you please let me know how to find that essay topic for this scholarship?  D wrote her coalition app essay. but we are unsure how to determine the strength of the essay. Any tips how to figure out if it is a strong essay?  ```\n"
