The big equity jackpots are not the common case for various reasons. Regarding signing bonuses, those MIT course 6-3 grads found a median signing bonus of $15,000, not $50,000.  Benefits obviously have value, but not $75,000 per year for the usual ones (medical, dental, disability, etc). Of course, there are plenty of state school CS graduates working in many of the same places for similar pay and benefits as MIT CS graduates.  Maybe less so in IB and MC, but is that the goal here?  ```\n"
