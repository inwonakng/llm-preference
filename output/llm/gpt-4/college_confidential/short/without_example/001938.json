If they are even for fit and cost, or if you aren\u2019t sure, I would choose Georgetown. However, BC is a good school, and if you strongly prefer Boston and/or the (full) D1 sports scene\u2026 or if there is a sizable difference in cost\u2026 then BC would make sense. For some context: Georgetown\u2019s undergraduate peers include (IMO) Notre Dame, Washington U, Rice, Emory, Vanderbilt, and maybe CMU. I have BC\u2019s peers as Wake Forest, Lehigh, Tulane, U of Rochester, NYU, BU, Case, Brandeis\u2026 maybe Tufts and USC. Some have those last two in a different group.  ```\n"
