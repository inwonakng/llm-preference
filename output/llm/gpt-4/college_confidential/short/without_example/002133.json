If you want to choose a school because of campus, honors college, and overall vibe, that\u2019s great. Just remember that when it comes to recruiting opportunities, recruiters won\u2019t give two figs about the campus or vibe and Ross (or other elite majors like CS at UIUC) will be seen as equivalent or superior to many honors colleges. But yes, you don\u2019t have to choose a school to maximum ROI or recruiting opportunities (though that is a uncommon tack for a b-school major, but I digress). BTW, I\u2019m speaking as a neutral.  ```\n"
