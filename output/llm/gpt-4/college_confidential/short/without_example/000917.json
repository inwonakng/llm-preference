So it comes down to whether full-tuition scholarship at USC beats out being full-pay at Stanford/Harvard. He can definitely get a job coming out of USC. That\u2019s a pretty low bar. But Stanford and Harvard are still more target schools for some industries than USC. So it really depends on what he is aiming for, how much being full-pay would hurt, etc.  ```\n"
