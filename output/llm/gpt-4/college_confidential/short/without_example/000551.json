[/quote]  Yes. You can expect to be in classes where it will be very difficult to earn an A. Unlike hs where As can be handed out like pez candy, perhaps only 15-20% of a class will get As.  You will face weeding out at both schools. You will be sitting in chem, physics, etc classes with not only other premeds, but also with other  bright non premed chem, physics majors, etc, all who are trying to earn the limited number of As a prof hands out. Premed is hard everywhere. I\u2019ve seen estimates that suggest 70ish% of those who start as premed change their minds for any number of reasons. Of those who actually apply, 60% will fail to start anywhere. Agree with @ Creekland, a Plan B is vital. https://www.aamc.org/download/321442/data/factstablea1.pdf Both schools will offer you the opportunities and resources to be a successful med school applicant. Whether you do so will be dependent mostly on you and your efforts, less on the school attended. Good luck.  ```\n"
