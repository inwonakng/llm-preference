He knew since first year of HS he wanted to be at Olin and was happy to have his gap year to get in.  He has some very close friends with whom he goes out all over the area with, and the 50-50 gender ratio also helps in the social life.  He spent his gap year at a very large state flagship university and did all the traditional college things there so he can easily compare the differences, and he still chose Olin after that year.  ```\n"
