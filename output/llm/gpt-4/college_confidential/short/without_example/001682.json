It\u2019s 2017, and top school represented in Silicon Valley. Duke is not on the list, and several schools you\u2019ve eliminated are ahead of Michigan. Hiring does tend to be regional though. That\u2019s why there\u2019s the high representation of CA publics. Also note this does not qualify what job, so it will be a conglomerate of SEs, CSs, and various engineers. http://www.businessinsider.com/top-colleges-for-working-in-silicon-valley-2017-5  ```\n"
