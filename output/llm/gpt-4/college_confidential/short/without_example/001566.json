Medical schools do not usually differentiate between universities at that level, and you want to save as much money as possible for medical school. But if you are not certain, or if you think you may change your mind, as do roughly have premed students, I think Yale may be worth a look, although I am not sure $60k of debt is worth it.  ```\n"
