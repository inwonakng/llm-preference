Wharton Undergrad - $184,000 plus interest NYU + MBA - $80,000 for half cost MBA +  minimum $230,000 in lost wages. Wharton undergrad is also better than most NYU + MBA/Masters programs. But yes, you can push the cost down the road to make sure you really want to pursue the field first. You also can be perfectly fine with just the Stern undergrad degree. It\u2019s a tough decision, I was just saying the cost analysis isn\u2019t so simple. There\u2019s a lot of variables.  ```\n"
