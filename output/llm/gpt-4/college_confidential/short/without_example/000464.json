With a $100,000 price differential, most people will give serious thought to very good, less expensive options such as UGA.  If the OP\u2019s family is truly wealthy (like top wealth), that is a different story and kids go anywhere they please. After all these posts,  I\u2019m still unclear what financial impact going  to IU would have on the family, whether or not there are younger siblings to educate,  Maybe I missed that.  Ideally,  financial limits are sorted out before applications even go out.  ```\n"
