Rutgers didn\u2019t give a dime of aid to us. I understand what my son means by having a feeling that Rutgers would be \u2018an extension of high school\u2019. That came from him, not me.

Everyone is different. But when a school shows interest and is offering significant aid, how Do you not look further into it.  ```\n"
