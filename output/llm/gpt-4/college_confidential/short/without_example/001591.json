NU features in the feeders for top 14  business and law programs, Rice does not.  Rice features in the list of top medical school feeders, NU does not! For what it is worth \u2026 the data is compiled from linked pages and probably isn\u2019t complete. Moreover, the data could indicate self-selection above anything else (more NU students are inclined towards business and law, or for other options, whereas more Rice students are inclined towards medicine).  ```\n"
