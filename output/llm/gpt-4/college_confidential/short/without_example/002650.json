[/quote]  This is what I\u2019m disagreeing with, if for nothing else, because Olin is in Boston\u2019s back yard. I disagree more so because of the previous qualifying sentence that Olin is a hands on program while GT is a \u201cworld class research institution.\u201d No doubt the latter is true, but the question is\u2026what does that have to do with the undergraduate learning experience? Olin is a direct response to large, yes very successful, research institutions, that don\u2019t put the maximum priority on undergraduate education to produce practicing engineers. The great research schools like Caltech, Berkeley, Stanford, etc. are also known to have very large classes, lots of TA instruction and a lack of principle application. Can they produce good bachelors level engineers? Sure. Does their status as a research institution help that? I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s a hindrance.  ```\n"
