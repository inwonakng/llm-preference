When my daughter was first looking at colleges she was turned off if a campus had a heavy Greek presence. She even questioned Kenyon early on when she read that 1/3 of students participate in fraternities/sororities. She ultimately decided it was a non-issue when she heard from several students things like \u201cThe frat guys here are poets\u201d LOL. It turned out to be an accurate description and she has gone to several \u201call campus\u201d parties thrown by the fraternities. Where on earth can you find fraternities that invite the whole campus?   ```\n"
