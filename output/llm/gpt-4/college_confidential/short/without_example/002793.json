      "content": "College A: ```Bates College```\nCollege B: ```Hamilton College```\nComment: ```Higher test scores at Hamilton can also just be an indicator that high test scores are important to Hamilton. Doesn\u2019t make the student body \u201cbetter\u201d or more interesting. Different schools chose to weight different criteria when deciding on who to accept. Bates\u2019 very long term policy of being test optional shows it is not a factor they weight as heavily as Hamilton. The test optional policy at Bates isn\u2019t some recent attempt to game the ratings game. My guess is they find little correlation between test scores and academic and career success. Bottomline, you can parse data for weeks and, given the fairly even standing of both schools on many levels, it won\u2019t matter as much in the long term as picking a school where you feel comfortable and supported. Could be either school or both. I would spend some time looking through the course catalog. I\u2019ve found big differences between LACs on course offerings. Even among similar schools, some schools have tons of courses that would interest me while others have ones that sound dry and boring, as much as one can go by course descriptions. Look at what might appeal to you in different areas of study. If you are interested in dabbling in some art classes, also check out how easy it is to get into a class as a non-art major.  ```\n"
