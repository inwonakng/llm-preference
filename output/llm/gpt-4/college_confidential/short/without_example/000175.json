PHEAA application has to be done before May 1 and there is a signature form to mail into Harrisburg. I think Pitt starts mailing out financial aid award letters in February. Make sure the school hasn\u2019t contacted you by email about FA. If you qualify for a Pell grant (what is your FAFSA EFC?), Pitt is starting a Pell grant match program. https://oafa.pitt.edu/pitt-success-pell-match/  ```\n"
