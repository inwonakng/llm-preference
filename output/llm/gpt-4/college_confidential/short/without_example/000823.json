Brown will be easier due to grade inflation, if that matters to him.  The schools are very different in terms of how academics are run (curves, grading, open vs more restricted curriculum) and especially how social life is (Duke is a big sports school - Brown is not, Duke has a more \u201ctraditional\u201d college vibe, etc.). Good performance at either school puts him in good positions fr grad school or employment after undergrad.  ```\n"
