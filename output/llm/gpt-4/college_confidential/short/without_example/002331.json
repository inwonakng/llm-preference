Price is NOT an object for this kid!! FYI, the Parchment cross-admit data (imperfect data but still data) says that Columbia thrashes UM on cross-admits 73% to 27%.  That\u2019s made even more impressive when you consider that some portion of those UM admits would be in-staters getting a deep discount on COA. \u201cMichigan is top-20 in almost everything and top-10 in most things. UCLA and UVA (especially UVA) can\u2019t say that.\u201d Don\u2019t you be messing with Mr. Jefferson\u2019s U.  Parchment says the kids like UVA (#23 ranked by student choices) more than UM (#26).   And UM undergrad hasn\u2019t beaten UVA in USNWR in like 25 years.  Wa-hoo-wa!!!  ```\n"
