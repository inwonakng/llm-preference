      "content": "College A: ```University of Michigan```\nCollege B: ```Duke University```\nComment: ```The fact most kids may choose Duke is because of their parents, perceived status elevation versus peers and myths about quality of education versus a world clsss school like Michigan. It\u2019s awfully good marketing to keep the checks coming. And it I think it also a bit of defending ones school, their kids or spouses school or validating choices made in life Duke offers a phenomenal experience. Cameron indoor is once in a lifetime great. Tenting  to get tickets for unc game is a great tradition. My nephew did the whole month this year. Alumni network is fantastic and rep is first tier.  But um and Ross offer many of the same things and at a price point for many that makes it a clear winner. Pragmatism and real life sacrifices are bandied about in CC with careless abandon. Caveat emptor.  ```\n"
