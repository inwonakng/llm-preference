Still, Cue, Hood, Guthrie, Myerson is pretty impressive (and they\u2019re all in technical positions except for Hood). I know that you can come up with a list of Berkeley alums who\u2019ve done exceedingly well in tech. I\u2019m not trying to say that Duke sends more people to the valley or anything of the sort. Just pointing out that our graduates are often disproportionately well represented in the highest echelons. Not bad for a school that is supposed to have a sub par CS program!  ```\n"
