You seemed to like both.  And, yes, despite its isolation, Kenyon\u2019s campus is gorgeous (Vassar\u2019s is no slouch either).  What do young people call it?  Hogwarts-like? Unless something seriously knocks either school out of contention between now and November+, apply to both.  If you\u2019re accepted at both, and both remain top choices, you\u2019ll have a chance to take even closer looks, read up, make contacts even.  Ultimately, you\u2019ll feel one more than the other.  There are no wrong choices here.  ```\n"
