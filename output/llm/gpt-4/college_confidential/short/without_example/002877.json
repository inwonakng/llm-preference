Also Cornell is a bit grade-deflated too but nowhere near as bad as Hopkins. Grade inflation/deflation is a important consideration for pre-med student. GPA can literally make you or break you in med school admissions. Personally my first choice would be Dartmouth and second Cornell and I would then apply to Hopkins for med school. All three schools are more or less similarly prestigious, probably Dartmouth and Cornell a bit more for undergrad because of the ivy league tag.  For medical school Hopkins is more prestigious.  ```\n"
