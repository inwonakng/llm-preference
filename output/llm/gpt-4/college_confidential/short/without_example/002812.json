[/quote]  This reflects the complementary (and incorrect) figure. For the class of 2020, 79.5% of Hamilton  applicants, and 81% of those enrolled, submitted traditional scoring. For the class of 2019, which corresponds to the ranges posted by Apple 23, 83% arrived after having submitted traditional scoring. (For those who are interested in statistics, note that the posted SAT scores, though, would be widened by an additional ~31 points based on these schools\u2019 respective reporting percentages.) That said, Based on what the OP has indicated so far, and as I stated up-thread, I think Bates might be the better fit for her/him. Actually, I\u2019m pretty sure of this. However, @hopeful1660 has yet to revisit Hamilton, and perhaps will have different comparative impressions after that time.  ```\n"
