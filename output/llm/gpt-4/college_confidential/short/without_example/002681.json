Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```@fatherofsam I don\u2019t think a fear of \u201closing\u201d students is why Olin discourages signing up as a matriculating student at another school during gap year. It is an ethical issue because the other school thinks they have a new student \u2013 but really doesn\u2019t.  Besides taking a spot from another student, it has a negative impact on the other school\u2019s stats. I could be wrong, but my understanding is that Olin doesn\u2019t have a problem with wait list students taking classes during their gap year \u2013 it is just that they don\u2019t want them accepting an admission offer from another school.  ```\n"
