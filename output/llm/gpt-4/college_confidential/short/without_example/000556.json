Among a group of puppies, some are naturally outgoing and adventurous and some are more wary.  Most of the wary ones can do just fine, but they need more exposure.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.  It\u2019s still a \u201cTrain up a \u2018puppy\u2019 in the way they should go\u201d deal (vs the way one feels \u201ceveryone\u201d should be trained up).  It\u2019s the end success that matters, not the means to get there.  (Success being defined the same for both, of course.) Students who love learning and challenge often love the big research schools (or any challenging class in any school) - challenge accepted.  Others, not so much.  It\u2019s all ok.  One just can\u2019t put a square peg into a round hole because they think that\u2019s the only way one can succeed.  That\u2019s when failure tends to happen. FWIW, this is not at all about lowering the bar with final knowledge - wanting pure memorization instead of true learning.  That\u2019s its own issue and definitely grates on my nerves as an educator when it\u2019s an end goal for any level of learning.  It\u2019s been around forever.  I recall not really understanding Calc until I got to actually use it in Physics.  My students do well in high school because I emphasize teaching them how to reason and think, not because I teach them \u201cStep 1 is to do this.\u201d  Granted, vocab has to be mostly memorized, but once that language is learned, most of the rest can be reasoned out.  Some vocab can be reasoned out as well if one knows root meanings.  The teachers considered the best by students at our school are those who teach (in an understandable way) using concepts for real life applications.  But that\u2019s totally different than whether a student will do better with challenge or confidence building.  ```\n"
