Finance degree from Ross would help you for other careers on wall street but NOT to be a true quant.\u201d blevine, Ross requires 55 credits for the completion of the major. Students can take their remaining 65 credits in LSA, and double majoring in Pure Mathematics and Business is definitely possible. If the OP wishes to pursue a career in Quantitative Analysis, a double degree from LSA (Mathematics) and Ross (Business) would serve him/her well. \u201cAlso note while there are MIch grads on wall street, there are far more Cornell grads in NYC and better networking opportunities as a result.\u201d I don\u2019t know about \u201cfar more\u201d. Obviously, Cornell is a NY institution, and 35% of its alumni are NY residents, so naturally, more of them will be working in NY. But Michigan is very well represented on Wall Street. I would definitely say that when it comes to IBanking placement, Ross matches Cornell. \u201cIthaca is a wonderful college town, I doubt Ann Arbor has anything better to offer in day to day lifestyle than Ithaca, it is often voted one of the BEST college towns.\u201d Did you actually visit Ann Arbor? I am an alum of both Cornell and Michigan. I lived in Ithaca for 2 years and Ann Arbor for 4 years. Ann Arbor has more to offer than Ithaca. Not just the city itself, but the surrounding areas as well.  ```\n"
