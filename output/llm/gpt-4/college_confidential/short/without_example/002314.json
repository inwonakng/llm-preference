I haven\u2019t even run across a Columbia undergrad here and at my stints in NY and Seattle, even taking into account the size of the schools.  Now the co-founder of Google and one of the co-founders of Sun having gone to UM undergrad helps with this or course.  The top five schools in terms or prestige out here for CS/engr are Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU, Michigan.  ```\n"
