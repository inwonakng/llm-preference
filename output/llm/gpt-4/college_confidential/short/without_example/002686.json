Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```I love it when people jump in when they don\u2019t have all the facts. For 2017, Olin does NOT permit part-time enrollment, which is what I stated above. This may have been different in year\u2019s past. This is directly from Olin: Are there any restrictions on what I can do during my gap year? You may spend your gap year traveling, working, volunteering or studying (and that\u2019s just to name a few ideas!). While you may take a course at another university, you may not enroll as a part-time or full-time student. Again, I\u2019m not bashing Olin - it is a fabulous school that my D would have very likely attended if not waitlisted. But I wanted to state the facts.  ```\n"
