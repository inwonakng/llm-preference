I\u2019ve heard great things about Profs Novy, Morrison, Borowoski, and Zuckerman! Seems like you could hit Brain and Behavior right after your info session, tour, and lunch, or alternatively, you could spend the afternoon taking to a few Pomona professors, eat dinner at the Village, and then spend a bit of time for the late night classes (you most likely won\u2019t have to stay the whole time). Just message the professors, let them know your purpose (you got off the waitlist at Pomona and would appreciate seeing what the academics look like at the Claremont Colleges), and I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be happy to accommodate you  ```\n"
