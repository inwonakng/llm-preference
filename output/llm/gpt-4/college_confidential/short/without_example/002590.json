It\u2019s a given that while some of us have tried to objectively compare the two colleges, we all have our biases. However, any commonalities you find among people who favor one school over the other are telling. For example, when I read the comments from current or incoming Carleton parents, I am detecting certain themes that resonate with me. It\u2019s no coincidence that I too am an incoming Carleton parent. Ask your son which themes resonate with him. That may help decide fit since you don\u2019t have the luxury of visiting both schools again.  ```\n"
