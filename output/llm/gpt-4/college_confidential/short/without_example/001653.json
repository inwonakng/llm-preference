For most engineering disciplines, any school in the top 10ish will be recruited comparably for jobs in their field right out of undergrad.  BMEs feel the difference, however.  Some of my best friends are BMEs (I know people at Johns Hopkins [#2 BME], Michigan [#9 BME], and Rutgers [#? BME]), and they and can attest to that.  ```\n"
