Posting some links that may be of interest: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-colleges-for-software-developers-2014-10 https://trinity.duke.edu/initiatives/quantitative-initiative https://news.crunchbase.com/news/venture-capitalists-go-college/ To put things in perspective, 56 VC investment partners did their undergrad at Berkeley while 32 went to Duke. Since Berkeley is roughly 5 times the size of Duke (and its student body is less academically diverse), Duke appears to be outperforming Berkeley handily on a per capita basis. This is just one metric but the point is that overall output should not be conflated with quality.  ```\n"
