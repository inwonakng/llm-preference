Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```There isn\u2019t a school where engineering is easy and everyone thinks their school is hard. In reality, the schools that ate notably harder than the test might boil down to one, Caltech. Their volume and pace are ridiculously high, and probably not to the benefit of the student (side note, two former Caltech profs told my son they wouldn\u2019t recommend it for undergrad). Anyhow, back on track. Difficulty is not a metric that will meaningfully differentiate the two. It\u2019s true that Olin is a good school and unique. If you apply yourself and do well, you will have opportunities. What\u2019s important to wrap your head around, is that statement is 100%, capital T true no matter where you go. To maximize your opportunity to thrive, fit then is the personal metric you should concern yourself with. If you\u2019re a square peg, don\u2019t pound yourself into a round hole. You won\u2019t be happy.  ```\n"
