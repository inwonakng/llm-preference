  "model_output": "Firstly, the comment discusses the concept of \"selectivity\" in college rankings, pointing out that it is not solely determined by the number of students a school turns away but rather by the quality of students that a school attracts. \n\nSecondly, the comment provides specific ranking data from the USN&WR ranking system in 2018 that shows Boston College (BC) was ranked #28 for selectivity, while Boston University (BU) was ranked #45. This indicates that Boston College was more selective than Boston University in that year.\n\nFinally, the author of the comment suggests that it would be foolish to choose BC over BU solely based on selectivity. This suggests that while they acknowledge BC's higher selectivity, they don't necessarily think it makes BC a better choice than BU.\n\nOverall, the comment doesn't strongly favor either Boston College or Boston University. The author acknowledges a specific strength of Boston College (selectivity), but also suggests that selectivity is not the only factor to consider when choosing a college.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
