  "model_output": "This comment appears undecided between the two options, there are just some facts about each one highlighted but the writer does not favor one over the other. The author just makes a silly comparison mentioning both universities have excellent standings with clinical and study opportunities, rigor and acceptation, and neither is draped under harsh academic norms, inflated or deflated grades. Additionally, the author hints vehemently one finding \"weed out\" courses at the universities. Notwithstanding, they also stress that most students don't normally pursue undergraduate and medical studies in the same institution, a fact which makes the size of the medical school class or reserved places pretty irrelevant. Therefore, taking all porints uni account, it's difficult to decipher a preference here hence there's quite a deliberated conclusion.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
