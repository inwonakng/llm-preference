They offer the person a piece of advice about working in a particular office and transferring to another one after a period of time, such as from Atlanta to Chicago.

Given this, we can conclude that a slight preference for the University of Georgia is shown in the comment over Indiana University.\n\n%%%\nA is preferred over B",
