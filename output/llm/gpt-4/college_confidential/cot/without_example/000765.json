  "model_output": "First, the commenter is discussing the environment at Johns Hopkins University (Option B). They mention hearing that it's \"cut-throat,\" which generally has a negative connotation suggesting a highly competitive and potentially stressful environment. \n\nSecond, they attribute this competitive environment to the large number of pre-med students at Johns Hopkins. \n\nThird, they suggest that the person they are responding to would not be affected by this competitive environment because their majors of interest do not attract many pre-med students and they do not appear to be a pre-med student themselves.\n\nHowever, there is no mention or comparison made to Pomona College (Option A) in the comment. As such, we can't determine a preference based on this comment alone.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
