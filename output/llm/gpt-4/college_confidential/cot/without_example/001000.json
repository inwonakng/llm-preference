This could be interpreted as a preference for USC based on financial considerations, but it's still not a direct comparison to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nTherefore, there is no clear preference stated between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Southern California in this comment.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
