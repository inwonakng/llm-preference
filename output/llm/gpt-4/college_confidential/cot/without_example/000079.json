The author only asks questions about a possible BME (Bachelor of Materials Engineering) pursuit and advises caution in choosing a school.\n\nThe question about what the student wants to do with a BME degree does not relate to preference between the two options. Furthermore, the well-wishes at the end do not indicate the author's preference. Therefore, no preference is given.\n\n### No preference",
