The size and difference of campuses are discussed-- Pennsylvania State University of Erie's smaller setup and having to shift after 2 years to a bigger one, juxtaposed with Virginia Tech's consistent schema, the latter evidently associated for this commenter with a \"full college experience.\" Virginia Tech, thus, is the slight implicit preference.\n\nIn addition, they recommend to inquire to Virginia Tech about its support systems in relation specifically to women in engineering, which indicates the writer's the potential positive estimation of Virginia Tech as a viable choice. Hence, while acknowledging that certain variables may tip the condition one way or another, there seems to lay a larger weight for the latter school.\n\n### \nB is preferred over A",
