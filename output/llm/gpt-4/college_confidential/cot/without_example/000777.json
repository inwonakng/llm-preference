  "model_output": "The comment is split into a detailed review of Pomona College and a shorter comparison with Johns Hopkins University. \n\nThe author starts by discussing the pros, mixed, and cons of studying computer science at Pomona College. They list several positive aspects including the community, academic preparation, outcomes, and opportunities for research and internships. They also mention some mixed aspects like the availability of internships in LA, and the cons include larger class sizes, difficulties in getting into classes for non-majors, a theoretical emphasis, and a smaller course selection. \n\nThen, the author compares the alumni network of Pomona and Johns Hopkins University. They argue that while JHU may have a larger network due to its size, Pomona has a more active and supportive alumni network. \n\nThe author acknowledges that JHU is more well-known and has strong research capabilities, but they argue that Pomona offers the best path for someone intending to go to graduate school. They then compare student ratings of the two schools, showing that Pomona has higher scores in several categories. \n\nFinally, the author acknowledges that they would choose Pomona, but they are biased because they are a Pomona grad. They conclude that both schools have their pros and cons and wish the reader good luck with their decision.\n\nThe author's preference is clearly indicated by their detailed praise of Pomona and their own choice to attend this school. They also acknowledge their bias towards Pomona. \n\n%%%\nA is preferred over B",
