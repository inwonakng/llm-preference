  "model_output": "First, we note that the comment is generally discussing the intellectual nature of students, not specifically comparing Stanford University and the University of Southern California.\n\nSecond, the comment does mention Stanford and gives the impression that while it has many intellectual students, it also has students who are not intellectual and are very career focused. However, the comment also implies that this situation is not unique to Stanford and is also the case at other universities including USC.\n\nThird, the comment does not provide a specific preference between Stanford and USC in terms of having an intellectual student body. Both universities are described as having a mix of intellectual and career-focused students.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that the comment does not express a clear preference for either Stanford or USC when it comes to the intellectual nature of their student bodies.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
