  "model_output": "The comment mentions both options, Duke University and Brown University, and acknowledges the merits of both. It points out that both have produced successful individuals and that the difference in outcomes isn't measurable. \n\nHowever, the comment goes on to discuss some distinguishing features of both universities. It mentions the strong Greek presence and big-time sports at Duke, implying that these are positive aspects. At the same time, it points out that Brown University's sports teams are not as strong and that Brown is more like a Liberal Arts College (LAC) with a strong focus on undergraduate studies. The comment also mentions that Brown students are known for being happy there.\n\nWhile the distinction between the two options is made, the comment does not express a clear preference for either university over the other. Instead, it provides information about the unique features of both universities and suggests that the choice should be based on social fit. \n\nTherefore, the comment does not show a strict preference for either option.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
