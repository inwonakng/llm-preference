The comment suggests a possible negative aspect of Pennsylvania State University, but there's no comparison or mention of Virginia Tech added to balance or contrast the statement.\n\nTherefore, there is no information provided to give a strict preference.\n\nHowever, the comment shows a negative feature of Pennsylvania State University but lacks an equivalent comment or context about Virginia Tech. Based on this it could be in some interpretations (although not strict one) that Virginia Tech could be preferred over Pennsylvania State University. \n\nTherefore the strict answer according to the rules is \"no preference\", but one alternative interpretation could be \"B is preferred over A\".\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
