  "model_output": "The key word in the comment is \"Berkeley,\" which means it relates to Option A: University of California, Berkeley. There is a direct mention of Berkeley. There's an additional consideration about its cost for out-of-state students shared in a negative context. However, Carnegie Mellon University (Option B) is not mentioned anywhere in the comment.\n\nFrom this, it appears the comment carries a negative sentiment towards Berkeley but offers no sentiment towards Carnegie Mellon University. Due to the lack of any direct comparison made between the two, it refers to Option A without a preference determination between the two options.\n\nTherefore, I reach the conclusion that this comment doesn't make a clear preference between them.\n\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
