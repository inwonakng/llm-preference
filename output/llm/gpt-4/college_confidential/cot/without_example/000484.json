Initially they disclose that they are alumni of Vassar, which might bring certain impulse in favor of option A but throughout the whole comment they were providing impartial selection process. Based on their observations, they depict Vassar students as 'down-to-earth', 'happy', unlike the 'pretentious vibe' they detected at Kenyon. The commenter was critical about the isolation of Kenyon college and the people he met at Kenyon in places including admissions and elsewhere. He further mentioned symbols around Kenyon campus portraying socially insensitive imagery (Confederate flags), referring as a negative factor which wasn\u2019t there at Vassar College.
