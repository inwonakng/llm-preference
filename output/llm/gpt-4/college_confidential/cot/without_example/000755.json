  "model_output": "Firstly, the comment mentions that there are a lot of schools between Wharton (which is a part of the University of Pennsylvania) and Stern (which is a part of New York University) that don't have a specific finance program. This statement does not directly express a preference for either university.\n\nSecondly, the comment addresses the issue of student loans and tuition fees. It implies that the University of Pennsylvania wouldn't ask for too much in student loans, which could suggest a preference for the University of Pennsylvania due to its perceived affordability.\n\nFinally, the comment concludes by saying that only the original poster's family can decide if the tuition is too much of a burden. This statement encourages the decision to be made on personal financial circumstances, and does not indicate a direct preference for either university.\n\nOverall, the comment does not clearly or directly express a preference for either the University of Pennsylvania or New York University. However, the implication of affordability at the University of Pennsylvania could be taken as a slight preference.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
