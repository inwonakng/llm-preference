At the same time, the user comments that  \"Penn is a good school\" but the increased cost of attendance \"isn\u2019t worth it as you can find same exact (if not better) role after Stern.\" The user also highlighted a benefit of being in NYC, which can be inferred as added advantages of choosing NYU. \nTaking these facts into consideration, it seems the user favors NYU over Penn. \n\n%%% \nB is preferred over A",
