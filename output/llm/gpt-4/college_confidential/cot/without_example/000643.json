  "model_output": "The comment discusses about the challenges that a student encounters to graduate early from an engineering curriculum. It narrates the experience of the commenter's son who, in spite of having significant existing credit hours and tracing his progress efficiently, was unable to graduate in less than four years. Furthermore, the son then decided to utilize his remaining time to complete graduate classes. It concludes with an observation about the engineering curriculum where many of the General Education (GE) hours go unused. \n\nHowever, the comment doesn't mention anything explicitly about University of California, Berkeley or University of Maryland. As a result, we cannot extract a comparison or preference between the two universities from the given comment. \n\n%%%\nNo preference",
