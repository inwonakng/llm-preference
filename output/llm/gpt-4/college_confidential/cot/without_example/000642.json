Firstly, this comment provides some experience with an unspecified engineering program, focusing mainly on the impossibility to graduate in less than four years and the plausibility to achieve a Bachelor's and Master's degree in about 4.5 years with well planning.\n\n2. On the specifics of the universities being compared, University of California, Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University, no mention about either of them is made during the comment.\n\n3. The person providing the comment does not necessarily display a preference of the academic experiences related to these two specified universities. This seems to be a general discussion about engineering programs, rather than a unique experience attached to either option A or option B.\n\nBecause there is no mention or implicit cue towards the two options, we can safely say there is no preference between the two in this comment.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
