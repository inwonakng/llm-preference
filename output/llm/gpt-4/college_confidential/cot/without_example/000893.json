  "model_output": "The comment seems to be referring to a discussion about the selectivity of Boston University (Option A) and Boston College (Option B). The commenter mentions an argument that Boston University is more selective than Boston College but also adds that Boston College is generally harder to get into. However, the commenter believes that this is a poor reason to choose between the two.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the commenter does not see the selectivity or difficulty of admission as a significant factor in preferring one over the other. The commenter does not express an explicit preference for either Boston University or Boston College based solely on this factor. Therefore, it's difficult to determine a clear preference.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
