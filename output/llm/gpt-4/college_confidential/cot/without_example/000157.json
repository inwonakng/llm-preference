  "model_output": "In the comment, the author mentions a distinctive trait of Option B \u2014 its new financial aid program \u2014 but no analogue initiatives at Option A are pointed out. While no clear preference is openly declared, the author stating the presence of a matching Pell grant program at Option B offers a subtle advantage. A precise analysis of the statement doesn't support a strong preference for any institution; however, the added piece of information about pointers could gently sway the decision towards Option B for people facing financial hardships.\n\nThis conclusion is inferred by critically examining the information within the author's comment, even though no direct preference is provided for one over the other.\n\n###\nB is preferred over A.",
