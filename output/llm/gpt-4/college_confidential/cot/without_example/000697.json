  "model_output": "Firstly, the comment does not mention or comment on the University of California, Berkeley, therefore we don't know the opinion of the commenter on this option (Option A). \n\nSecondly, the commenter mentions University of Maryland (Option B) and makes positive comments about it. They suggest that studying at University of Maryland would be a good opportunity to receive a solid education and opportunities for internships. They also reinforce the attractiveness of option B by advising to sweeten the idea with the prospect of a trip to Europe with the money saved.\n\nThere's no comparison or comment regarding University of California, Berkeley (Option A), therefore no clear preference can be established about University of California, Berkeley over or under University of Maryland. \n\nHowever, since there is a positive stance towards University of Maryland (Option B) and no mention of University of California, Berkeley, it can be inferred that University of Maryland is preferred over an omitted preference, the mentioning of University of California, Berkeley.\n\n%%%\nB is preferred over A.",
