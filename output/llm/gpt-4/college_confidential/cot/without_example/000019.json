  "model_output": "The author of the comment here mentions that a proximity to a world-class research university is highly beneficial, although it doesn't necessarily specify what ambits they're referring to that makes it so valuable. Later on, however, the comment mentions the birthplace of BME (Biomedical Engineering), with an insinuation that this origin location appears highly impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, the comment does not provide a distinct mention of either California Institute of Technology (Option A)  or Georgia Institute of Technology (Option B) in reference to these beneficial features. Thus, given the lack of specific detail it's not clear if it's favoring one institute over the other.\n\nIn the absence of specific reference, we must deem this comment as an instance where the judgement of preference is non-conclusive.\n\n### No preference",
