  "model_output": "First, the comment does not explicitly mention either University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign or University of Southern California. It discusses the idea of intellectual students and their presence in various universities, but does not indicate a preference for either of the two options.\n\nThe comment discusses intellectual students who choose to take merit scholarships and are often overlooked by Ivy League schools, but again, does not specify a preference for either of the two universities in question.\n\nThe comment mentions that many universities, including USC, have students who are intellectual and others who are career-focused. However, this is not a clear indication of preference for USC over the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as no comparison is made.\n\nThe comment also talks about what \"making a difference\" means, but this does not indicate a preference for either university.\n\nGiven that the comment does not mention University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign at all, and while it does mention USC, it does so in a broad context without expressing a clear preference, we can conclude that there is no preference expressed in this comment.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
