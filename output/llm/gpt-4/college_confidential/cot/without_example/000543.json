  "model_output": "First, there is no mention of both the University of Rochester or Emory University in the comment. Despite providing a significant advice on how to choose a medical school, the commentator focuses on aspects like the mission of the school, rigorous coursework, approaches used by the schools, and success in professional life. There are no evaluative statements on the listed universities. Because neither option A nor option B are addressed in the comment, I conclude there isn't a preference between the two options. \n\n%%% \nNo preference",
