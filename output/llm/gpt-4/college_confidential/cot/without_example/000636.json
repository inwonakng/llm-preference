  "model_output": "First, both University of California, Berkeley (Option A) and Carnegie Mellon University (Option B) are mentioned in the options, but not explicitly mentioned or compared in the comment. It is stated that the individual doesn't want to go to UMD, which is not one of the options given, meaning this does not have any effect on our assessment.\n\nNext, the comment focuses on considerations related to AP credits being accepted and financial matters affecting educational decisions. However, these things are equally important regardless of attending either University of California, Berkeley or Carnegie Mellon University which again, aren't discussed with specificity.\n\nBy analyzing the overall jist of the statement, hence we find that there's no explicit or implicit comparative choice given in this particular comment for either Option A or Option B.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
