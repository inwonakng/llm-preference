The user provides links to the university's financial aid and scholarship information, indicating they have researched or are familiar with these aspects of Option A.\n\nSecondly, there is no mention of the University of Southern California (Option B) in the comment. We have no information about the user's feelings or knowledge towards Option B.\n\nBased on these observations, we can infer that the user seems to be more interested in or knowledgeable about Option A, but this does not necessarily indicate a preference for Option A over Option B. \n\nHowever, since the comment does not discuss Option B at all, it can be inferred that the user may have a slight preference for Option A over Option B, even though it might be due to the topic of discussion rather than an overall preference.\n\n%%%\nA is preferred over B",
