The speaker says his daughter was easily accepted to Kelley and the Hutton Honors College at IU but was deferred at UGA, implying UGA may be more competitive or selective.\n\n2) The speaker states UGA is \"definitely more competitive\" overall than IU, and repeatedly highlights the increasing difficulty of being accepted into UGA, which supports UGA as a preferred choice.\n\n3) While the speaker applauds IU's Kelley School, they opine that outside of this school, IU's remaining programs are \"pretty average academically\" - this potentially undermines IU as an option.\n\n4) The commentator notes that some people may exaggerate the distinction between UGA and IU, acknowledging Kelley's value, but maintains that \"it's no Wharton.\" Here, IU is appreciated but not preferable when signposted against broader standards.\n\n5) Assessment grades required to admit to Kelly (a subset organization-spatial j\u00e4ger of Indiana University) are lower than those for UGA, serving a further blow to IU's appeal for stringent education-seekers. \n\n6) The comment concludes with the bold assertion \"UGA seems to be the clear winner.\" In addition to the speaker's argument regarding its competitive edge-work and demonstration of tough love.\n\n%%%\nA is preferred over B",
