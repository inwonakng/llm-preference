The only time either of the options are referenced is with the mention of Indiana - they note a suspicion that Indiana might waive non-resident tuitions if awarded a scholarship. However, mentioning Indiana University does not indicate a preference between it and the University of Georgia. Therefore, there is not strictly a preference revealed for one university over the other in this comment.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
