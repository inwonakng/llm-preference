However, there is no mention of University of Maryland to potentially compare it to the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nGiven these points, it's clear that the person is not thinking highly of the University of California, Berkeley.\nBut without any mention or comparison to the University of Maryland, it's impossible to determine if the commenter favors or disapproves of that university. Therefore, there isn't a clear preference between these two.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
