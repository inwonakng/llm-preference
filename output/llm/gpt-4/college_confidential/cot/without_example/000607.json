  "model_output": "The comment seems to express a preference for the University of Maryland (option B) in the context of engineering, suggesting that it would provide numerous opportunities either for industry work or for graduate school. The comparison is focused on student success limiting a contributor to being solely for engineering courses/students at Maryland. Although the University of California, Berkeley (option A) was not spoken about positively or negatively in this context, we can infer that the comment indicates a recommendation over the Berkeley institute due to its mention as a 'no-brainer'. Despite assumptions that opulence of opportunity would be similar at both universities, Maryland is being directed at exclusively, leading us to believe it is their preference. No other clear distinctions between choices A and B are made, and neither choice is deprecated which implies they are both regarded highly, with the statement swaying towards Option B.\n\n%%%\nB is preferred over A",
