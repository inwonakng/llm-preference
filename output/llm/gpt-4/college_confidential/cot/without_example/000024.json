The comment mentions GaTech too, however, since GaTech is not part of the property on the table, those parts will be skipped.\n\nGoing into depth for the property on the table: \n\nThe comment mentions Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and highlights that it might be a tad better at systems biology for those keen on research work. However, the user states the rank difference between JHU and GaTech (not related to our main property but still mentioning JHU) as not being significant, implying that the user views these institutions at a similar level.\n\nAs for the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the users seems to state a differentiating and in essence glorifying factor: the level of math and physics assumed for incoming students is that of advanced calculus and college physics. This casts Caltech comparatively in a more challenging bracket than others, showcasing a rigorous academic proficiency expected. \n\nAt the end, the user explicitly draws comparison between JHU, GaTech and Caltech; noting how both universities are not as challenging as Caltech when it comes to subjects like physics and mathematics.\n\nThis analysis implies a graduation in ranking or preference, despite any stated explicitly: Caltech holds the higher echelon in comparison due to its rigorous academic intensity viewed as a mark of high academic competence, thereafter JHU and GaTech follow.\n\n###\n\nA is preferred over B",
