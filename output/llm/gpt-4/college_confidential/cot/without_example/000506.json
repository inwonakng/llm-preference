  "model_output": "The comment compares several options among midwestern existing liberal arts colleges (not only Vassar and Kenyon) primarily basing on academics, vibes, and location. While making comparisons, the point of comparing urban-nature of cities in which the colleges are situated gave a somewhat clear indication of appreciation towards the services offered by college A-Vassar. Here, a direct comparison is seen where Vassar is stated to feel 'more urban' than Macalester and more populated than Carleton. No direct comparison between the two A and B options was made, but it isn't noted without significant detail that Kenyon college was known for having strength in music/humanities.\n\nBecause A - Vassar is discussed in extended detail reflecting an appreciation (if even slight) more so than B - Kenyon, that shows a mild preference towards A.\n\n%%%\nA is preferred over B.",
