They then ask if the user has looked into opportunities in the Baltimore Washington corridor, again suggesting that they believe JHU may provide more opportunities in the user's areas of interest. They state that both schools are fine and that a good case could be made for either one, which does not indicate a clear preference.\n\nHowever, the commenter then states, \"For your specific areas of interest, I would think JHU offers greater breadth/depth.\" This is a clear indication of a preference for JHU based on the user's intended majors. They then suggest that the user should consider this more than prestige or name-recognition, further indicating a preference for JHU based on the academic offerings.\n\nThe commenter then makes a conditional statement: \"However, if I weren\u2019t satisfied that good opportunities extend to undergrads at JHU, I\u2019d probably prefer the Pomona/Claremont environment.\" This suggests a potential preference for Pomona College, but only under certain conditions. The condition being satisfaction with opportunities for undergraduates at JHU. \n\nOverall, while there is some consideration given to Pomona College, the majority of the comment indicates a preference for Johns Hopkins University based on the user's intended majors and potential opportunities in the Baltimore Washington corridor.\n\n%%%\nB is preferred over A",
