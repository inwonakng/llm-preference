  "model_output": "The comment begins by discussing the importance of the college's brand name for humanities majors and how it can boost one's career prospects. However, it goes on to mention that for technical fields, the brand name doesn't matter as much. The user then touches on the field of economics/business which is the intended field of study for the original poster's son. The user suggests that in this field, the brand name might matter more, which could imply a preference towards Stanford University due to its higher prestige.\n\nThe user then mentions a recurring question of choosing between Stanford/Harvard (with full payment) vs schools like USC with full tuition merit. They say that the opinion seems to be 10 to 1 in favor of merit (which could imply a preference towards schools like University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that might offer more merit-based scholarships), but they have yet to see anyone take up that option. This statement leaves it a bit ambiguous as to whether the preference is towards Stanford due to its prestige or University of Illinois due to potential merit-based scholarships.\n\nIn conclusion, the user seems to lean more towards the importance of a college's brand name, especially for the field of economics/business. However, they also acknowledge the appeal of merit-based scholarships. Given these points, it seems like there is a slight preference towards Stanford University due to its higher prestige, but the user also appreciates the value of merit-based scholarships. \n\n%%%\nA is preferred over B",
