The comment suggests that the reputation of a university matters for humanities majors, but not as much for tech-related majors. However, the user does not explicitly express a preference for either school over the other. They simply discuss the common question of choosing between a prestigious university with full tuition (like Stanford or Harvard) versus a school like USC with full-tuition merit. Despite an apparent majority opinion favoring the merit option (which would be USC in this case), the user notes that they haven't seen many people actually choose that option. This may imply a preference for Stanford, but it's not explicitly stated.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
