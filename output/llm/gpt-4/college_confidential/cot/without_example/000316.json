The speaker equates its reputation to that of Pennsylvania State University (PSU) and the University of Maryland (UMD). From the words \"equal to PSU\", we can deduce that the speaker considers VT and PSU of the same caliber in terms of their reputation especially in the STEM field. \n\nThey neither strictly prefer one over the other nor do they say that either of them is inferior to the other.
