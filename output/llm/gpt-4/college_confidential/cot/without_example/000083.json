However, neither of these entities are directly mentioned in the given comment.\n\nThe quote in the comment mentions \"Caltech student\" but neither mentions Johns Hopkins University nor Georgia Institute of Technology. The preference is based on the assumption of there being \"no marginal students at Caltech\".\n\nGiven the lack of direct reference or comparison in the comment between the two options presented (Johns Hopkins University and Georgia Institute of Technology), one cannot determine if there's a preference for one option over the other. We do not have enough contextual information about Caltech and how it relates to or measures against Johns Hopkins University and Georgia Institute of Technology to make an accurate decision based on this comment.\n\n###\n\nNo preference",
