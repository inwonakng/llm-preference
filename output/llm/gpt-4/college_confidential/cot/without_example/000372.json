  "model_output": "The comment seems to focus a lot on the price and procedures at Pennsylvania State University (PSU), particularly differentiating between their main campus and one of their regional campuses (PSU Erie). The person provides detailed information regarding the cost of education for specific programs at the main and regional campuses of PSU, and even provides advice on blindspots like the cost of intending to transfer from a regional PSU to the main one.\n\nRutgers University, Option B, isn't mentioned whatsoever in this comment. Because there's no information or opinions expressed about Rutgers, we can't determine any comparison or preference between the two universities in this context.\n\nTherefore, in this particular case, it can be concluded that the comment doesn't express a strict preference for either Option A or Option B.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
