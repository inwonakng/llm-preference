JHU has a graduation rate of 87.6% within 4 years, whereas Caltech's is 78.3%. The comment is essentially suggesting that a higher proportion of students graduated from JHU in 4 years than from Caltech. This can subtly imply that JHU could be considered better in terms of having a high graduation rate within a four-year time frame, which could be advantageous to students who wish to complete their studies in a timely manner.\n\nHowever, the commenter also warns against rash comparisons, particularly while considering Georgia Tech's case where a large percentage of students engage in co-ops, extending their overall time to graduation without necessarily incurring extra tuition cost. This rings a note of caution, hinting that while numbers may favor one institution, there could be other factors in play affecting these numbers.\n\nThus, there seems to be a slight preference towards JHU in terms of graduation rates, nevertheless, considerations around these figures are advised.\n### B is preferred over A",
