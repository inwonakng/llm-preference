  "model_output": "First, the comment starts by mentioning the different campus environments of BU and BC, without expressing a clear preference for either. \n\nThen, it mentions the stereotypes of students at each school, again without showing a preference. \n\nNext, it discusses selectivity rates at both schools, stating that BU has made more strides in this area than BC. This suggests a slight preference for BU.\n\nAfter that, it talks about the endowment of both schools, highlighting that BU has to share its endowment among more students, which could be interpreted as a slight negative point for BU.\n\nNext, the commenter mentions the research output of both schools, stating that BU generally carries more weight in the sciences. This could be seen as a preference for BU, especially for those interested in science.\n\nLastly, the commenter advises the reader to do their own research, and states that both are great options, without expressing a clear preference.\n\nDespite a few points that could be interpreted as a slight preference for BU (such as selectivity and research output), the overall tone of the comment seems to convey that the choice depends on personal factors and that both are good choices. Therefore, there is no strong or definitive preference.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
