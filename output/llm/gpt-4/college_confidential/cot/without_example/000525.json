There is no mention of Vassar College in the comment.\n\nGiven these points, it's apparent that there's no longer a negative preference for Kenyon due to the mentioned ongoing efforts it's making to improve its situation. However, there's no overt or explicit preference stated for either Kenyon College or Vassar College. Only Kenyon College was discussed, with both positive and negative viewpoints, while the other was completely left unaddressed.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
