  "model_output": "Firstly, the comment seems to highly consider the placement and necessity for an MBA later-on from both universities. The user suggests that Wharton (option A) has an edge in 'placement' and might decrease the need for pursuing an MBA in future, later-on describing Wharton as \"riskier\" with an \"edge in placement\". However, the comment strongly leans towards Stern (option B) being safer and preferable if finances and the burden on the user's family are considered.\n\nSecondly, personal preferences are discussed positively for both Wharton and Stern in terms of campus culture, though the commenter argues it depends on individual circumstances and perspectives.\n\nLastly, they mention that unless OP (original poster) really loves Penn (Which is short for the University of Pennsylvania, i.e. Option A), and if her parents can financially support the cost, Stern (B) is the better option.\n\nUpon weighing these aspects, it's clear the user presents a consideration for both options, recognizing merits of both but leaning towards NYU Stern maybe due to a 'safer' path and less of a financial burden which seems to be the deciding factors here.\n\n%%%\nB is preferred over A",
