  "model_output": "The comment doesn't seem to favor Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), noting it's not for everyone and \"renowned\" is put in quotes. Furthermore, the comment seems to question if CMU is worth a \"major premium\" for engineering.\n\nAlthough not directly mentioned, University of California, Berkeley (UCB) could be inferred as being indirectly mentioned, as it's well-known for engineering programs. The \"major premium\" might suggest that the commenter believes UCB to have a more notable program than CMU.\n\nHowever, this does contain a good deal of speculation as there's no direct comparison made or direct mention of UCB. As such, direct preference is hard to ascertain from this comment. \n\n%%%\nNo preference",
