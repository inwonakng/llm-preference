  "model_output": "Throughout the comment, the preference seems more leaned towards Virginia Tech (option B). The commenter describes having a pleasant experience at Virginia Tech which indicates a bias towards option B. It suggests a favorable view of Virginia Tech's academic schedule, environment, and impact post-graduation. Although the comment somewhat praises Pennsylvania State University, it does so on the bases outside the personal connection and anecdote related to Virginia Tech. In contrast, the preference for Virginia Tech is deeply rooted in their direct experience. On this basis, I deduce that there is a preference to Virginia Tech over Pennsylvania State University, although isn't widespread or clear cut.\n\n### B is preferred over A",
