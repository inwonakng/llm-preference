They provide insight into the college's CS Department, particularly its struggle to meet the demand with the available faculty. They suggest that a student must be a CS major to get priority in classes.\n\n2. The parent also shares that their child, an Economics major, faced difficulties in completing a CS minor due to the high demand for CS classes. They add that some departments at Pomona require certain major-specific courses to be completed at the college itself.\n\n3.
