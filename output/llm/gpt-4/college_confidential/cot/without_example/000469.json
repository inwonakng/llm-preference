The user '@DG' has been mentioned and it said that the commenter agrees to all their posts. From this line, no specific mention of or preference for either University of Georgia or Indiana University is indicated. \n\n4. The second part of the comment discusses 'OP' being undecided on his major; this is irrelevant to the University options, as it does not help indicate a preference for one over the other. \n\n5. To conclude, there is no discernable preference for either the University of Georgia or Indiana University established in this user comment. \n\n%%%\nNo preference",
