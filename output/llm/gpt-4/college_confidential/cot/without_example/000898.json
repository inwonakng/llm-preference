  "model_output": "The comment provides a perspective on both Boston University (BU) and Boston College (BC). It states that BC is more selective and attracts \"preppy kids,\" while BU has a more diverse mix of students, reflecting a high-performing suburban Boston high school. The commenter also mentions that both are good choices and it's all about fit. \n\nAlthough the commenter provides information about both institutions, there is no direct preference indicated. The commenter's tone is neutral and they seem to value both choices equally, but highlight that they serve different types of students. \n\nThis leads me to conclude that there is no strict preference between the two options based on the comment given. \n\n%%% \nNo preference",
