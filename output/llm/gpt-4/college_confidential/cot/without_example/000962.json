  "model_output": "The comment discusses various aspects of Stanford University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and other universities as well, but the major comparison is not directed towards these two. It seems that the commenter is mainly discussing the value of Stanford and Harvard in comparison with USC, which is offered as a free ride. The commenter seems to approve of the idea of taking advantage of a free ride at USC, instead of paying a large amount to study at Stanford or Harvard. However, the commenter does mention that if it were revenue neutral, they would choose Stanford or Harvard. These points reflect a somewhat preference for Stanford over University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, but the mention of Illinois is missing in the comment, which makes it difficult to definitively say that Stanford is preferred over Illinois based on this comment.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
