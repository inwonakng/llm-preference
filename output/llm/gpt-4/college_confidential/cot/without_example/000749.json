  "model_output": "The comment makes it clear that pursuing an MBA could happen among both schools, but the user particularly mentions factors that make ever Wharton prospective student consider trying to balance the value of going to back to Wharton for an MBA or heading for a different track. The comment makes it seem likely that Wharton is of high status but can be unattainable or overly expensive for some. Concerning NYU, the user has a possibility of mostly mentioning that concentrating in finance might place them in identical contention as those concentrating in finance at Wharton; nevertheless, the OP started by bearing much focus on Wharton, not decisively stating NYU is a better alternative. While recognizing the worth of NYU Stern's finance program, the message does not pointedly convey absolute preference for one over the other because it describes a circumstance wherein they might be perceived as exhibiting similar opportunities. The message stays ambiguous.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
