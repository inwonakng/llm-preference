It indicates that neither school would inherently advantage or disadvantage the person for grad school admissions. \n\nThe comment does highlight some differences between the two schools. It mentions that Pomona has a joint department of Cognitive Science and Linguistics and offers a computation-oriented track of the Cognitive Science major. It also benefits from being in a consortium with Harvey Mudd, which deepens the offerings in Computer Science and AI.\n\nOn the other hand, the comment says that Johns Hopkins is likely to have more of a pre-med focus, which could affect the experience of the person. However, it also mentions that Johns Hopkins is strong in Computer Science.\n\nIn terms of the overall environment, the comment suggests that Pomona is more nurturing and undergrad-focused, whereas Johns Hopkins has more going on at the graduate level.\n\nIt seems that the comment does not explicitly prefer one option over the other, but rather points out the strengths of each school and suggests that the decision should be based on a preference for a nurturing, undergrad-focused environment or an environment with more graduate level activities.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
