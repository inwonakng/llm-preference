  "model_output": "There are mentions of both options within the comment (Cornell University (\"Cornell\") and Virginia Tech (\"Vtech\")). However, neither is explicitly preferred over the other. The phrase \"If you can afford Cornell\" shows that Cornell University may not be feasible due to cost reasons. On the other hand, Virginia Tech is suggested as one of the places to consider for an overnight visit, suggesting it remains a part of the discussion, but nothing expressing clear preference. It's also important to note that other options and factors (like Case, RPI, affordability, and visiting schools) come into play in this decision, indicating a more complex consideration than simply preferring Cornell or Virginia Tech. Therefore, no direct preference between these two options can be clearly identified from this comment.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
