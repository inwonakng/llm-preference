The overall discussion is focusing on a third, unlisted, option rather than University of California, Berkeley or Carnegie Mellon University. \n\nThe author of the post also mentions \"The family needs to decide for themselves though  if the sustantial cost  is worth it to go elsewhere\", meaning some form of comparison is made, but this elsewhere doesn't implicitly or clearly refer to either of the aforementioned options.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
