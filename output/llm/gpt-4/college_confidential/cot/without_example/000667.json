  "model_output": "The comment speaker begins by highlighting the difference in cost between students paying out-of-state fees and those that are residents, finding it unreasonable for the latter. Then they note the benefits of attending UCB (being high ranked and affordable for residents) but simultaneously point out several negatives such as large class sizes, impacted majors, and a less diverse geography of the student body. \n\nThe speaker brings up Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as a comparison, indicating the value for the money lies in private universities like CMU due to smaller class sizes, abundance of sections, and geographic diversity, presenting these features with appreciation. \n\nHowever, there is neither a comparison nor a comment in relation to the University of Maryland. Considering this, no preference between UCB or University of Maryland can be declared based on this comment. \n\n%%%\nNo preference",
