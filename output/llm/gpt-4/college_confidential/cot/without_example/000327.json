  "model_output": "The comment is pointing out the misleading nature of college admission percentages and then uses Penn State as an example. The comment says that Penn State admitted students to the main University Park campus with significantly lower stats than some business and engineering pre-majors. This doesn't necessarily indicate any disdain for Penn State but rather for the way the admission percentages are portrayed. However, there's no mention or inference made about Rutgers University at all in the comment.\n\nHence, there's no direct or indirect preference between Penn State and Rutgers University expressed in the comment.\n## No preference",
