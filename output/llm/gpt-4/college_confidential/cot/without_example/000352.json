However, the speaker does share an impressive fact about Virginia Tech being the fifth largest provider of engineering graduates. Without knowing the context of the conversation, other direct comparisons, or any other complementary details about Pennsylvania State University from the speaker, it's hard to definitively say one school is favored over the other based on the information given. The comment doesn't indicate an outright preference, rather the inferred adoration of and fascination with Virginia Tech being the fifth largest provider of engineering may indicate a slight bias towards option B. Without additional evidence to strongly pressure towards either option, it is best to err on the side of caution and to which they preferred.\n\n### No preference",
