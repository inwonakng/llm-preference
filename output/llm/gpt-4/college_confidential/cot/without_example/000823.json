  "model_output": "The comment mentions some key differences between Duke University (Option A) and Brown University (Option B) in terms of academics and social life. However, it does not explicitly express a preference for one over the other. \n\nThe comment presents a comparison, stating that Brown University might be easier due to grade inflation, suggesting that the commenter sees this as a possible advantage. On the other hand, the commenter also acknowledges that good performance at either school would put a student in a good position for graduate school or employment. \n\nThe mention of the different social scenes, with Duke as a big sports school and having a more \u201ctraditional\u201d college vibe, compared to Brown, is not framed as a preference but as a point of difference. It's up to the individual to decide what they prefer in terms of social life. \n\nThe comment therefore does not lean towards one university over the other, but rather highlights their differences for consideration. \n\n%%%\nNo preference",
