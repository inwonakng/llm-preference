However, there is no specific mention of Virginia Tech\u2014which is Option B\u2014in this comment at all. The lack of a comparative statement between these two universities makes it difficult to determine a specific preference between Rutgers University and Virginia Tech. Therefore, one cannot definitively ascertain that either Option A (Rutgers University) or Option B (Virginia Tech) is preferred based on the information mentioned in the comment.\n\nYet, the implication that Rutgers University is a standing option they're considering might cause one to lean towards Option A.\n\n###\n\nA is preferred over B.",
