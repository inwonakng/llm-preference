The person conducting the review and comparison makes no mention of either the Pennsylvania State University or Rutgers University. \n\nInstead, the author seems to be engaged in a discussion about Virginia Tech's contribution to the field of engineering, with no comparisons made to either Option A or Option B.\n\nSince the subjects of comparison (Option A and Option B) are not addressed or even mentioned in the comment, there is no expressed preference between them. \n\n### No preference",
