Also, each of these mentions remains neutral and do not lean in favor or against one or the other.\n\nLastly, there isn't any particular aspect or quality indicating a preference towards either university; it instead discusses \"research assistant\" roles in general rather than specifically at either university.\n\nTherefore, due to the lack of any persuasive or clear qualitative comparisons between either university from the comment, no particular preference can be derived.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
