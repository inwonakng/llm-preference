However, the commenter personally does not regard lower acceptance rates as an accurate measure of a university's prestige. They imply they do not necessarily prefer Emory over the University of Rochester due to its lower acceptance rate. It seems that they equally consider both Emory and the University of Rochester, regardless of differences in acceptance rates, and moreover, argue it would be unfair to declare Emory superior based merely on that fact. However, they did not express any notable direct preference for Option A or Option B in the comment. \n\n%%%\nNo preference",
