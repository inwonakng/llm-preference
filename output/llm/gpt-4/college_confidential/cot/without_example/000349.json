  "model_output": "In the given comment, the comparison primarily comes down to Cornell University and Virginia Tech, for their respective engineering programs. There is indeed a preference mentioned towards the end of the comment, where the mention of Pennsylvania State University is merely a passing phrase expressing the user's lack of knowledge about PSU's engineering program. Schools similar to Pennsylvania State University like Rutgers are deemed undesirable. \n\nLastly, Rutgers and PSU are grouped together as schools the user doesn't know much about, and have been dismissed entirely. It should be clear that Virginia Tech, is highly favored in this comment. There is no comparison made between PSU and VT, only the asker's acknowledgment that she lacks experiences with PSU but clearly adores VT. Therefore, preference would squarely go to Virginia Tech.\n\nThe most telling evidence is how the user expressed their satisfaction with VT. They mention how happy everyone seems to be there, the inclusivity and friendliness of the students, the ambitions of the students plan to attend graduate school, and that the daughter has made it to the dean\u2019s list in the past mush up the parent happy. Strong favorable points of that friend who is a CEO attesting to the competence and quality of VT graduates receive far greater detailing than the PSU does. \n\n### \nB is preferred over A",
