  "model_output": "In the comment, the user argues for smaller campus universities where everything is within walking distance. The commenter states that such campuses provide benefits for busy students, like engineers. The user then brings up Rutgers as an example of a university where students might have to commute to class using buses because of the distributed nature of the campus. Comparatively, Virginia Tech is not mentioned at all in the comment.\n\nThis comment does suggest a preference of a certain type of university over others. However, since Virginia Tech is not mentioned in the comment at all, determining the comparative preferences for Rutgers University versus Virginia Tech directly from the comment is impossible.\n\nMy conclusion, because of the details from the comment and lack of comparison expressed in it, it's reasonable to state that no strict preference has been set between Option A, Rutgers University, and Option B, Virginia Tech.\n\n%%%\nNo preference.",
