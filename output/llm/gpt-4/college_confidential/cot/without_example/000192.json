This indicates they think both schools would be a good choice depending on financial concerns. \n\nThen the user mentions B is physically separated from the main campus and has closer links to the industry, which adds to B's merit. Meanwhile, the user points out that A is a larger university, but it is not clear whether this aspect is considered to contribute positively or negatively to A.\n\nTowards the end, positive comments regarding nightlife and downtown proximity are made by alluding to B's location, which adds to B's value.\n\nHowever, a concrete explicit preference isn't provided in the comment.
