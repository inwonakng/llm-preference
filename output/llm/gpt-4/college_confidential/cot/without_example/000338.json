  "model_output": "The commenter is talking about Virginia Tech (Option B) in a largely positive and intrigued way. They are trying to discuss the validity of a statistic that, if true, presents Virginia Tech as an outstanding institution for engineering. On the other hand, Option A, Rutgers University, is not mentioned at all within the comment.\n\nOn this basis, the commenter doesn't share a preference between Option A and Option B because the latter is solely present in their comment. They seem interested in Virginia Tech's engineering program, with no context provided relating to their thoughts about Rutgers University. We can't state they prefer Option B over Option A from this comment alone, we can only identify that they have a positive reaction to specific information about Option Bvi\n\n### No preference",
