In this comment, the commenter does not express any distinct preference towards either Option A (Pennsylvania State University) or Option B (North Carolina State University). The author elaborates more on a third option which is not part of our focus.\n\n2. No specific point made regarding Option A or Option B. There was no favoritism or discrimination portrayed in terms of attributes or characteristics for both the options.\n\n3. Towards the end of the comment, the commenter generalizes that all three universities, including Option A and B, are projected to have very good employment opportunities. So we cannot ascertain if one is preferred over the other. Hence, without any explicit or even suggestive remark about a preference, we cannot logically pick a preferred option from A and B based on this particular comment.\n\n###\n\nNo preference.",
