  "model_output": "The comment discusses the concept of what an \"intellectual student body\" means and the different types of students that can be found in universities. The comment also mentions that Stanford University is not \"intellectual\" but clarifies that it has many students who are intellectual and also students who are not and are very career-focused. However, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is not mentioned at all in the comment.\n\nBased on this, we cannot determine a clear preference for either Stanford University or University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as the comment only discusses one of the options, Stanford University, but does not express a clear preference for it over the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign or vice versa.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
