It does mention that Stanford is associated with needs-based aid and that full tuition is a good offer, but it's unclear if this is specifically related to Stanford or a general statement. The comment also says that USC is a good school, but this is a neutral statement and doesn't indicate a preference either way. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine a preference between the two options.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
