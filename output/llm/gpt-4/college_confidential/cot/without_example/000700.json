  "model_output": "Firstly, in the comment, we have praise that specifically refers to the University of Maryland (UMD), describing it as an \"ABET accredited\" institution with \"good recruiting\". Moreover, the evaluation of UMD as a \"well respected school\" also positions it in a positive light. Notably, within the same comment, there is reference to the \"substantial cost...to go elsewhere\". Although Option A, which is University of California, Berkeley, isn't directly mentioned, this could possibly be read as negative \u2014 suggesting that other options, including Berkeley, might have higher costs.\n\nHence, the preference for UMD over Berkeley might be inferred based on the positive views shared about UMD. Further strengthening this assertion, doubt is expressed about whether it is worth the and the perceived increment in cost is actually worth it if one considers opting for an option (like Berkeley) other than UMD. \n\nTherefore, given the visibly positive attitude towards UMD and the indirect questioning towards alternatives (like Berkeley) provide a strong hint of a preference towards the University of Maryland.\n\n%%% \nB is preferred over A",
