They seem to favor the latter option, which implies a preference for USC over not just Harvard/Stanford, but potentially other universities as well. \n\nHowever, in the given comparison, the commenter does not mention or compare USC to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Option A). Therefore, while there is a clear positive sentiment towards USC, there is no comparative statement made between USC and the University of Illinois.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
