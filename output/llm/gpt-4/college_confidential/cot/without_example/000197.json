  "model_output": "The user starts by acknowledging that all three universities have great reputations in engineering. However, they specifically highlight NC State's location close to numerous potential employers. This proximity, the user suggests, simplifies logistics significantly when it comes to interviewing, securing housing for internships, and possible school-year internships. Following this line of thought, we can disagree that the user shows no preference in their comment.
