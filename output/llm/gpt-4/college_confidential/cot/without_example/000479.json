It rather evaluates two different academic degrees, an MBA and a Masters in Accounting.\n\nThe comment simply mentions Indiana-Kelley's MBA program in a questioning context, without showing any sentiment\u2014favorable or unfavorable\u2014directly towards the University of Georgia or Indiana University.\n\nTherefore, neither University of Georgia (Option A) nor Indiana University (Option B) seems to be preferred one over the other in this comment.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
