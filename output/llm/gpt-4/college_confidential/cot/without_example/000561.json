  "model_output": "Firstly, the commenter is engaged in a discussion about how well-preparatory undergraduate colleges are for med school, particularly focusing on the importance of GPA versus rigorous curriculum. We can observe two fair statements about both med schools and rigorous undergradutes: that med schools are designed to provide all necessary teaching regardless of undergrad curriculum's complexity, and that more robust undergrad curriculums might end up giving students a headstart. \n\nInterestingly enough, an example is provided regarding a student who attended University of Rochester (Option A), stating that this student's undergraduate education quite effectively prepared him for the coursework he would face in med school. There seems to be some praise and a positive opinion here. However, it's been clarified that this is ultimately an anecdotal case, making it less overarching as a recommendation specific to University of Rochester. \n\nComparatively, there is no mentioned anecdote, opinion or data about Emory University's (Option B) capacity to prepare its students for med school. \n\nFor this reason, we can only work with the visible evidence which anecdotally favors University of Rochester (option A). However, bear in mind this preference is based on a singular anecdotal instance. \n\n%%%\nA is preferred over B",
