The person discusses the complexity of Knowledge evolution concentration in new fields. Here, they recognize Johns Hopkins University (B) as covering a broad range of Biomedical Engineering (BME). However, in regard to the California Institute of Technology, any reference was omitted entirely - they only mention \"GT,\" which is not identified as a competing party herein.
