  "model_output": "First, we try find either explicit comparison or bias towards either option A (University of Pennsylvania) or option B (New York University). In order to do this, we look for positive or negative made words regarding any of these universities or a direct comparison between these two. In the given comment, we see there is a mention of the University of Pennsylvania with a negative connotation, indicating the commenter believes Penn is overrated. However, without a reference to NYU, it is not possible to compare any potential preferences.\nSecond, while there is negativity regarding Penn, we don't know about the speaker's sentiment towards NYU. So, we can conclude the speaker doesn't prefer Penn but we're uncertain about their view of NYU.\nGiven the lack of reference to NYU and only a negative sentiment for Penn, it is not possible to determine a clear preference between these two universities based on this comment.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
