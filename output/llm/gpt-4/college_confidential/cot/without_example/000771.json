  "model_output": "The comment starts by discussing the ability to cross register at the 5Cs, which is something related to Pomona College. The commenter is arguing that this feature may compensate for JHU's wider range of classes. The user continues discussing the issue of course availability, but without making an explicit comparison between Pomona and JHU. Near the end, the user mentions a specific issue at Mudd (part of the 5Cs, and hence related to Pomona), but again, without comparing it to JHU. Lastly, the user states that they don't have much opinion beyond that. \n\nThroughout the comment, the user does not express a clear preference for either Pomona or JHU. While they do discuss some advantages and disadvantages, these are not compared directly, and no clear choice is made.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
