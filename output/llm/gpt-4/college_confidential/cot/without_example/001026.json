  "model_output": "The comment seems to be expressing negativity towards the University of Southern California (USC) due to the perceived unfair rejection of two high school students. The author implies that USC might not value intellectual individuals, as evidenced by the rejection of these students. The author even suggests that USC might want to reconsider the degrees of the two students' parents, who are also highly intellectual and respected in their field.  \n\nHowever, there is no explicit mention or comparison made between USC and Stanford University in the comment. Therefore, we cannot determine a preference based on this comment.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
