The commenter then quotes a university scholarship that has a list of things they will consider, further proving that they are seeking clarity about University of Maryland. The final question is also centered on tips for producing a strong essay for a scholarship application - presumably for University of Maryland as well. \n\nHowever, there is absolutely no reference or mention of the University of California, Berkeley in the entire commentary.
