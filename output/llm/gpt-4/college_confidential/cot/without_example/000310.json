The user applies emphasis on the cost factor of Penn state but does not mention anything about Virginia Tech at all.\n\nTherefore, based on this comment, we cannot confidently determine a preference between these two options as there are no explicit positive or negative associations made for either options A or B.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can make a final decision.\n### No preference",
