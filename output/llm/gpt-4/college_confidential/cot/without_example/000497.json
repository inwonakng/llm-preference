They criticize another user for doing a \"disservice\" by perhaps not acknowledging this problem at Kenyon College.\n\nOn the other hand, Vassar College isn't explicitly mentioned in the comment other than being presented as an option, so no direct comparative statements are made between the two colleges.\n\nHowever, given the intense criticism of Kenyon College, it can be inferred that the commentator either prefers any other option over Kenyon. Therefore, since Vassar College is the only alternative provided, we could take such criticism as an indirect preference for Option A: Vassar College.\n\nHowever, remember that it remains speculative, as the actual preference isn't explicitly stated in the comment and with no discussion whatsoever about Vassar College. \n\n%%%\nA is preferred over B",
