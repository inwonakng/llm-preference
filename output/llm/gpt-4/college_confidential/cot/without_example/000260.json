The person is awaiting a review of Virginia Tech, showing interest, but does not state a preference between it and North Carolina State University. Similarly, while they do mention a concern with the culture at Penn state, this is not relevant to the two options in question, which makes determination of preference more difficult. Overall, the information provided does not clearly indicate a preference.\n\n### No preference",
