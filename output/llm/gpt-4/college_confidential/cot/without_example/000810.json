However, it's not clear that this preference is held by the person making the comment, as they could simply be stating a fact.\n\nSecondly, the comment mentions that the person's child was interested in attending a larger school, which suggests a preference for Johns Hopkins University on the part of the child, considering it's larger than Pomona College.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the comment doesn't explicitly state a preference for either option. Instead, it provides information about both options and implies a preference on the part of the child, not the commenter. The commenter does not clearly state their own preference.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
