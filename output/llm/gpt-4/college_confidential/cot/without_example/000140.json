  "model_output": "The comment doesn't explicitly mention \"University of Richmond,\" hence, no direct preference for University of Richmond can be inferred. Nevertheless, the commenter states \"Sounds like you really want to go to Haverford\". This suggests the comment-maker thinks the person being addressed has a keen interest in or preference for \"Haverford College\". It can also be implied that the commenter favors Haverford College as they describe it as \"a great college,\" without questioning one's intentions to go to Haverford College.\n\nConsequently, by connecting these observations, I conclude that the comment exhibits a bias towards Option B, revealing a stronger preference.\n\n###\n\nB is preferred over A",
