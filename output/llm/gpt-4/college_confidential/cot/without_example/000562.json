When the commenter states, \"Both are rigorous\", he equates them both in that regard, indicating no discernible preference.\n3. Then, by adding the statement about differences in acceptance rates, the commenter directly dispels the notion of equating\u2014in this context\u2014the prestige or the quality of a university's student body with its rate of acceptance, implying no one university superior over the other based solely on admissions numbers.\n4. Importantly, throughout these comments, there is no explicit comparison that postulates one preference over the other, nor an inherent, recognizable bias at play which may imply a possible latent predilection.\n5. Thus, in assessing this commentary for directed preference, it is reasonable to conclude a state of balanced evaluation where both universities are treated equally.\n\n%%%\nEqual preference",
