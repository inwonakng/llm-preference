Instead, the comment is a discussion about different universities and their engineering programs, including talking about the benefits of a larger campus with more competition, supports for women in engineering, and the \u201cfull college experience\u201d. Given this lack of any reference to either option, it seems clear that there is no preference in this comment for either Option A (Pennsylvania State University) or Option B (Rutgers University).\n\n### No preference",
