However, the third option does not contain \"North Carolina State University.\"\n\n- Is there any consensus against both of the choices?\nThere's no evidence of antipathy or negativity towards either choice.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nWhile the speaker contains an emotional preference for Virginia Tech, there's insufficient detail in the comment to point to the North Carolina State University, excluding verifying a strict preference.\n\n### No preference",
