However, the commenter then defends USC, stating that many smart and successful individuals graduate from USC. This shows a positive view of Option B.\n3. The commenter also says that a USC candidate could be in the same PhD program as a Stanford graduate, which suggests that they see the two universities as being on similar levels.\n4. They acknowledge that some students at USC may not have the same academic stats as those at Stanford or University of Chicago, but argue that these students might still be smart and successful. This could be seen as a slight negative towards USC as compared to Stanford, but it's followed by a positive view of USC students' potential.\n5. The final statement defends USC against the claim that its students aren't intellectual, which shows a positive opinion towards Option B.\n\nBased on these points, while there seems to be some acknowledgement that Stanford might be seen as a more prestigious institution, the overall tone of the comment is defending USC and arguing that it is also a strong university. Therefore, there is no clear preference between the two.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
