  "model_output": "Firstly, the commenter mentions that they and someone referred to as 'H' are alumni of Virginia Tech (VT). They clearly have an affinity for VT; the commenter even states 'my vote goes to VT'. \n\n'Something else that demonstrates a preference is that H turned down a place at North Carolina State University for VT, but that was old news though noted nonetheless. There's expressed pride in how well H is doing now with his own company serving the commenter thinks this might possibly be an outcome accessible thanks to VT. Additionally, the writer praises the physical setting of VT and mentions improvements since their time there.\n\nWhen ICMP mention NC State, it's to say that there are plenty of successful graduates from it living in NC where H comes from. This can mean that though they're discussing Option B positively, ICMP are admitting that Option A has its successes as well\u2014which can contribute to an assumption that a degree from both schools could lead to a successful career.\n\nThe comment finishes with them advising the reader to pick upon finances and where they think they want to live once graduated and imply that they'll be fine with degrees from any of the colleges being considered inclusive of ones not listed in this particular stand.\n\nWith these several notes above combined, there appears to be a general support towards Virginia Tech over North Carolina.\n\n###   \nB is preferred over A.",
