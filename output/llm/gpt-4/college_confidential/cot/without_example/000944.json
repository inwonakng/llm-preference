  "model_output": "The commenter is making a comparison between the two options, Stanford University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nFirstly, he states that the alumni network is arguably stronger or at least as strong, though he does not specify for which university. Therefore, this point does not help us establish a clear preference.\n\nNext, he mentions that one option is much cheaper, but again, he does not say which one.\n\nFinally, he mentions that if he had a lot of money, he would pick Stanford, indicating a preference for Stanford if cost was not a factor. However, if the cost was a factor, he would choose to take a big scholarship to USC and invest that money. Although he mentions USC instead of the University of Illinois, the implication is that if cost is a factor, he would not choose Stanford.\n\nIn conclusion, the commenter does not express a clear preference for either Stanford University or the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His preference would depend on his financial situation. Therefore, it is difficult to determine a clear preference based on this comment.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
