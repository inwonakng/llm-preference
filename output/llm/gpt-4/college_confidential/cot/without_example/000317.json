The University being debated seems to be excellent in STEM, level with some other notable institutions.\n\n3. The comment is absent of any mentions or specific references to Rutgers University, thus, we cannot determine any comparison between Virginia Tech and Rutgers from it.\n\n4. However, we \ncan derive that the commentator appreciates the status of Virginia Tech's reputation in the context of STEM education. That said, this appreciation doesn't necessarily point to a preference between Virginia Tech and Rutgers University as no comparison or contrasting was performed against the other.\n\n5. Therefore, due to the lack of evidence pertaining to a strict preference between Virginia Tech versus Rutgers University, we conclude no preference exists demonstrable from the comment.\n\n\n### No preference",
