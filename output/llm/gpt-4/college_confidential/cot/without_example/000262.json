This clearly indicates that the person making the comment is more interested in details about Pennsylvania State University (Option A). Therefore, there is a preference towards Option A.\n\nHowever, they're not explicitly stating that they prefer Pennsylvania State University over Virginia Tech (Option B), it's implied as they only inquire about details regarding Option A.
