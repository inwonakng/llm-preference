  "model_output": "The comment is a critique of a post discussing features of both the University of Pennsylvania and New York University. The commenter's arguments cover scholarships, quality of resumes, competition for jobs between the two universities, savings, and pay level. Despite occurring critiques about incorrect statements related to both universities, particular attention is brought to the mistaken idea of needing a degree from Wharton (a school within the University of Pennsylvania) to be able to compete for jobs and earn high income, which the commenter believes also can be achieved through a degree from Stern (a school within New York University).\n\nGiven that these critiques provide a basis for challenging any presumed superiority of Wharton and bring the opportunities offered by Stern into a comparable and competitive perspective, it can be argued that this comment leans towards about equating the opportunities both universities, or even perhaps suggests a slight preference for Stern due to factors like potential financial savings. \n\nHowever, it should be noted that the comment does not explicitly indicate a clear preference between the two. With that said, the balancing nature of the critiques and the recognition of both as valid choices makes it alike an \u201cequal preference\u201d point of view.\n\n%%%\nEqual preference",
