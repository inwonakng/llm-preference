It indirectly implies that the user, who could be a local and plans on applying, may consider choosing GT due to the higher chance of admission for those in-state.\n\nHowever, there is no comparative information or comment about the California Institute of Technology (Option A).

The commenter gives a fact about GT but no personal preference between the two options.\n\n### \nNo Preference",
