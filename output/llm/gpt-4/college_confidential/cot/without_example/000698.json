  "model_output": "1. The comment starts with a hierarchy saying \"CMU &gt; Cal\", presenting Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as superior to Cal. This however does not compare CMU to University of Maryland (UMD).\n2. The comment then states \"free UMD totally trumps CMU\" This explicitly shows a preference to UMD when it comes to paying cost for education.\n3. The initiator furthers the comments saying, classes at both UMD and CMU will be the same which shows he sees both universities deliver similar teaching substance, and thus there's no preference based on the content of the education.\n4. Similarly, the chance for internships after attending either CU or UMD is mentioned as being almost the same.\n5. Value of the universities in getting a job post graduation is stated as being equally insignificant.\n6. There seems to be an economic preference towards UMD considering it's less costly especially when factoring in the Europe trip.\n\nMy conclusion:\nWhile the comment does not directly endorse either CMU or UMD by stating superiority in any key aspects (like quality of education, availability of opportunities, reputation) it does indicate University of Maryland is highly preferred when the cost factor is taken into account. This is mentioned explicitly.\n\n%%%\nB is preferred over A",
