The commenter talks about their personal experience and has positive feelings for their time at UGA (University of Georgia), however, they acknowledge that their experience might not be the same for others. This neither clearly expresses preference, nor argues for overall superiority.\n\n2. They reinforce a prior statement that there is not an academic difference between UGA and IU (Indiana University), particularly in the field of accounting. This suggests there's no preference based on academics.\n\n3. The next part discusses that one's own professional prospects shape the ultimate value of their degree, rather than the origin. Here, both schools have equal prestige, since both have a good reputation with employers for their accounting programs and it is suggested that either could successfully lead to a great first job.\n\n4. Even in a following part, relating to MBAs and Masters in Accounting, there is no distinct preference given to either institution.\n\n5. They talk about their dinner meeting with an IU graduate, their comparison concludes that both degrees from UGA and IU are respected within the job market, and both the commentator and IU graduate had positive college experiences.\n\nApplying this analysis, while there are positive feelings about UGA due to personal experience, it does not equate to a strict preference for UGA, because every evidence about academic quality, recruitment, trust of employers, degrees feedback maintain both UGA and IU are at an equal level.\n\n%%%\nEqual preference",
