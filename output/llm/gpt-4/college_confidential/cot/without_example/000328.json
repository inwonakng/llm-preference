  "model_output": "Okay. Firstly, the comment discusses Penn State University which falls under Option A. Particular points are made about the college's admission percentages, main University Park campus, and business and engineering pre-majors. \n\nThe negative tone toward Penn State is palpable. However, even though negative aspects of Penn State (Option A) are discussed, this comment does not make any explicit or implicit references to Virginia Tech (Option B). The speaker doesn't draw a direct comparison between the two universities. Any preference or lack thereof between Penn State and Virginia Tech within this comment is therefore unclear. \n\n### No preference",
