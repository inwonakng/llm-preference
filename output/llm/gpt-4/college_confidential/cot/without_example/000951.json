  "model_output": "The comment starts by pointing out a perceived shortcoming at Stanford University: it doesn't have an undergraduate business major. The comment suggests that many students switch to Computer Science once they enroll, and many get internships at top tech companies after their first year. \n\nThe comment then gives advice that could apply to either university: \"If you initially planned or worked all the way to what you have now, maybe you should stay with your original plan.\" This statement suggests that the choice should depend on the individual\u2019s original plans and preparations, but it doesn't express a clear preference for either Stanford University or University of Southern California.\n\nFinally, the comment states that parents need to be able/willing/ready to pay to make it happen. This might be a consideration for both universities, but again, it doesn't clearly favor one over the other.\n\nGiven these observations, it is not possible to determine a clear preference for either Stanford University or University of Southern California based on this comment.\n\n%%% \nNo preference",
