They raise the point that Caltech excels in equipping its students for advanced degrees, who they perceive to be \"geniuses,\" which can imply superior quality. On the detractions side, they mention that the intense curriculum may not be best suited for unleashing the full potential of the engineering discipline's practical dimensions. It is perceived that while brilliant individuals may emerge from Caltech, it could be considered less practical and therefore less suitable for practical engineering professions. A key detail: they reinforced their point by stating that many successful, professionals in influential positions come from diverse higher education backgrounds, reflected in Representative institutions, and none illustrate a Caltech connection. Georgia Technology Institute is not mentioned at all, implicating there it hardly bears relevance in this context, depriving it of a favorable or unfavorable side for a comparison. They notably suggest there aren't \"magic schools\" in guaranteeing success, which appears to leaning towards neutralizing or equalizing potential educational bias but does not really serve the comparative assessment since Georgia Institute of Technology isn't mentioned at all.\n\n### \nNo preference",
