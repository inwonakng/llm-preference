This data suggests a preference for JHU as graduating kids better both in 4 years and in 6 years. \n\nSecond, the user goes over the topic of student demographics and class sizes in which again JHU seems to have better stats with gender ratio being 49% men, 51% women showing better gender inclinations than Georgia Tech. He also talks about the difference in sizes and here again JHU rates better with only 10% of its classes having more than 50 students and a whopping 74% of their classes having less than 20 students. Georgia Tech doesn\u2019t come out as well on this metric, with 26% of its classes having more than 50 students and just 39% having less than 20.\n\nFrom the comment, there isn't any negative inclination toward the two options, but comparing both would show that there seems to be a preference of option A (Johns Hopkins University) over Option B (Georgia Institute of Technology) based on the better statistics presented on Option A on a general level. The user seems to be pointing out these strengths of Option A. This does not in any way imply that option B is not a good school, but the preference here tilts towards A.\n\n### \nA is preferred over B",
