  "model_output": "The user starts the comment by stating their brother's recommendation against sending someone to the University of Maryland, in particular, to the School of Engineering, because of its high drop-out rate and a lack of personnel attention due to size. A counterargument is made stating that despite many universities, likely including Maryland, not being as selective in the past, a strong student who earns a full scholarship could handle the academic rigour. However, this doesn't point to a preference, just a refutation of an opinion.\n\nIn the next part of the comment, this user's brother recommends sending that same someone to university at Carnegie Mellon University, not University of California, Berkeley or University of Maryland. Berkeley is not mentioned throughout the comment, hence we can conclude that the opinion is predominantly about Maryland rather than Berkeley.\n\nIn conclusion, since the two given options are University of California, Berkeley and University of Maryland, the inference here seems to be drawing from the comparison to a third not-listed option (Carnegie Mellon University). No opinion is expressed regarding Berkeley, hence we wouldn't be able to fairly deduce a preference towards any of the observable options in this scenario.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
