This scholarship receives special mention for its \"amazing\" perks. \n\nOn the other hand, there is no explicit mention of Johns Hopkins University (Option A), neither a negative nor a positive reference. \n\nTherefore, based on the information presented in the comment, it seems that there is a preference toward Georgia Institute of Technology due to its association with the prestigious scholarship.\n\n###\nB is preferred over A.",
