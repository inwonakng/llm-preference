  "model_output": "Firstly, the commenter mentions what an MBA degree overall can do for the person regarding tailoring their career. In this genaral comment, no specific preference is shown towards University of Pennsylvania or New York University.\n\nSecondly, the commenter states a financial benefit linked to \"earning a top finance degree\", without explicitly linking this to any specific university. No preference has revealed so far during this step.\n\nIn the next step, the commenter starts to refer to specific school programs, i.e. finance at both Penn-Wharton (which refers to the business school at the University of Pennsylvania) and NYU-Stern (referring to the business school at New York University). They rank both 5th and 9th respectively, informing about the relatively high level programs at both schools. The commenter points to the need of OP to have a plan and reevaluation if she doesn't use these specialized resources at NYU, meaning OP could throw away a good opportunity. This though does not indicate a clear preference, just that OP needs to reconsider her plans in general if not pursuing these highly ranked disciplines particularly at NYU Stern.\n\nFinally, considering all previous mentions, the commenter concludes with, \"But as presented, NYU is the better choice at such a significant discount.\" This assertion tends towards Option B, New York University, based mainly on the arguments of cost-effectiveness previously outlined.\n\n%%%\nB is preferred over A",
