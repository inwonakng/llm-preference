  "model_output": "The comment talks extensively about the two options provided, namely Indiana University (IU) and the University of Georgia (UGA). They maintain an impartial perspective throughout, comparing multiple facets of the schools like location, price, prestige, internship possibilities etc, without outright expressing a preference. Both schools are spoken positively about, with overall evaluations as great places of education. Certain factors are highlighted which may make Indiana University (option B) look less preferred at certain points, such as its percentage of students changing faculties and the perception of prestige, but these arguments are not leaning heavily towards University of Georgia (option A), this slant is just slightly visible in terms of the information provided. \n\nHowever, important to note is a direct question asked within the text \"Is Kelley [Indiana University / OU] worth $100k more than UGA [University of George]?\". The writer suggests 'probably not', containing a direct preference comparison between UGA and IU which leans towards UGA. Still the truthfulness of this bias is not 100% apparent as it amounts mainly as a suggestion, the phrasing \"probably no\" speaks more volumes around 'considering carefully before committing', rather than 'UGA is superior to IU'.  \n\nIn summary, recognizing the mostly neutral tone presented and lack of an overwhelming favourable view towards either option in the light of the information provided, directly seen is their recommendation to balance costs of education and determine which is the better fit for personal situations.\n\n%%%\nNo preference",
