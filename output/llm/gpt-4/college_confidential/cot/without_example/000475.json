The comment suggests that if money wasn't a constraint, Kelley (as represented for Indiana University's Kelley School of Business) would be the preferred university due to its diversity and a larger reach in terms of recognition across the country when compared to the University of Georgia (UGA).\n2. The commenter opines that while Indiana University may not be at the same level as some other top-tier schools, it still draws in students from punishable institutes while UGA doesn't have such distinction.\n3. The OP's wider experience, geographic location, and broader students base are reasoned as some of the benefits of opting for Indiana University.\n4.
