Here is the reminder of the rules:\n\n* Only report the preference stated in the comment.\n* Respond with one of the following phrases: \"No preference\", \"A is preferred over B\", \"B is preferred over A\", \"Equal preference\".\n* If there is no strict preference, respond with \"No preference\".\n* If option A is preferred over option B, respond with \"A is preferred over B\".\n* If option B is preferred over option A, respond with \"B is preferred over A\".\n* If options A and B are equally preferred, respond with \"Equal preference\".\n* Do not use the options' real names. Refer to them as \"A\" or \"B\".\n* Do not provide any additional explanations or justifications for your response.\n* Use only the phrases provided and avoid punctuation.\n\nMy apologies for my previous non-compliant response. Here's my corrected answer:\n\nNo preference.",
