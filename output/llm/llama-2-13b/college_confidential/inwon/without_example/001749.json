  "model_output": "Based on the information provided in the comment, there is a clear preference for Option A, University of Michigan. The comment highlights the low acceptance rate for full rides at UMich (less than 0.2% of admitted students) and notes that the admission rate will be below 25% this year, indicating that getting into UMich is quite challenging. This suggests that the speaker prefers UMich over Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which is Option B. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\"A is preferred over B.\"",
