  "model_output": "Based on the comment, there is a preference for Option A, University of Texas at Austin. The author mentions that Mendoza is nationally known and excellent, but also notes that there is a lot of risk involved with choosing it over McCombs, which is also excellent. This suggests that while both options are strong, the author leans towards UT Austin due to its national recognition and reputation. Therefore, the correct response would be:\n\n\"No preference.\"",
