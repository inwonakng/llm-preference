  "model_output": "Based on the comment, there is no strict preference expressed for either Option A (Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering) or Option B (Georgia Institute of Technology). However, the author does mention that their daughter ultimately chose Georgia Institute of Technology because of the opportunity to experience a small community within a larger school, which offered more opportunities than Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. Therefore, the preference is leaning towards Option B, but not strictly so.\n\nSo, the appropriate response would be:\n\n\"No preference.\"",
