  "model_output": "Based on the comment, there is a preference for Option A (North Carolina State University). The author mentions that NCSU has a wonderful campus and is a good choice for STEM fields, although it may not be as flexible for switching majors. On the other hand, Syracuse University is mentioned as being more difficult to get into and the author knows less about its flexibility. Overall, the author seems to prefer NCSU due to its location, size, and variety of majors. Therefore, the correct response would be:\n\n\"No preference.\"",
