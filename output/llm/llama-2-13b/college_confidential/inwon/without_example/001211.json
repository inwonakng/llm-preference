The author of the comment mentions that History, Philosophy, and Political Science are highly rated at WashU and suggests that it may be a better fit for the student's interests and career goals. Additionally, the author notes that St. Louis has a more manageable snow situation compared to Boston, which could be important for students from Hong Kong.
