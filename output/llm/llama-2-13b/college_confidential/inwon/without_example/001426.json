The author of the comment mentions that Northwestern has a slightly better academic reputation, but notes that the difference is not significant enough to justify the higher cost of attendance. The comment also includes a detailed ranking system for various universities, but does not explicitly state a preference for either Option A or Option B. Therefore, the correct response would be:\n\n\"No preference.\"",
