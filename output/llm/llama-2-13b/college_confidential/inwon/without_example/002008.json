  "model_output": "Based on the comment, there is a clear preference for Option B: University of California, Berkeley. The author of the comment states that Berkeley is not in the same class as elite private universities like Duke University when it comes to the overall quality of the student body, and provides reasons such as the weighting of high school GPAs and the practice of super-scoring on standardized tests. There is no explicit mention of a preference for Duke University, so based on the provided information, it can be concluded that the author prefers Berkeley over Duke. Therefore, the appropriate response would be:\n\n\"B is preferred over A.\"",
