  "model_output": "Based on the comment, there is no strict preference expressed for either Option A (Northwestern University) or Option B (Rice University). The author of the comment mentions that both universities have strengths in different areas, with Northwestern being slightly stronger in academic rigor overall, while Rice excels in STEM fields. However, the author notes that the differences are relatively small, and the choice ultimately depends on the student's intended major and personal preferences. There is also no mention of a significant difference in cost. Therefore, the appropriate response would be:\n\n\"No preference.\"",
