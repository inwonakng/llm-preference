The author of the comment mentions being unfamiliar with UICI (presumably referring to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), but notes that it has been referred to as a \"public ivy\" in the thread. The author does not explicitly express a preference for either option. Therefore, the appropriate response would be:\n\n\"No preference.\"",
