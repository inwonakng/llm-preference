The comment provides information about financial aid at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, including that approximately half of the aid is based on merit and half is based on need, and that they do not offer aid to international students. However, there is no mention of University of Southern California or any comparison between the two options. Therefore, the correct response would be:\n\n\"No preference.\"",
