  "model_output": "Based on the comment, there is no clear preference expressed for either Option A (Vanderbilt University) or Option B (Northwestern University). The author emphasizes the importance of considering the financial aspects of medical school and encourages the reader to research the tuition costs and available aid at each institution. They also mention that both Vanderbilt and Northwestern offer a good chance at getting a low-cost medical education, so neither option is clearly preferred over the other. Therefore, the appropriate response would be:\n\n\"No preference.\"",
