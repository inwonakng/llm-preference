  "model_output": "Based on the comment, there is no strict preference expressed for either Option A (Stanford University) or Option B (Princeton University). The author of the comment mentions that both universities are excellent academically, but the decision ultimately comes down to logistics. Since the author's family is located on the West Coast, it would be easier for them to attend meets and visit if the student attends Stanford, which is located on the West Coast. However, the author does not mention any specific concerns about cost or scholarships, so there is no clear preference for either university based on these factors. Therefore, the appropriate response would be:\n\n\"No preference.\"",
