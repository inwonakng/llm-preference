  "model_output": "Based on the comment, there is no strict preference expressed for either Washington University in St. Louis (Option A) or Bowdoin College (Option B). However, the author does provide some information about both options:\n\n* Bowdoin College is described as small, with a close-knit community and easy access to Boston via train.\n* Washington University in St. Louis has a nicer campus and is located in a large metropolitan area with good public transportation options.\n\nOverall, the decision seems to come down to personal preference for urban vs. rural settings and the specific location desired. Therefore, the appropriate response would be:\n\n\"Equal preference.\"",
