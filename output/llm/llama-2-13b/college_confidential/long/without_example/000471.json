The comment suggests that while rankings may not be the sole determining factor in choosing a university, they do have some correlation with employment outcomes. However, the comment also acknowledges that there may be exceptions, and therefore does not explicitly state a strong preference for either option based solely on rankings. Therefore, the appropriate response would be:\n\n\"No preference.\"",
