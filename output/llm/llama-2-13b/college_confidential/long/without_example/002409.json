  "model_output": "Based on the comment, there is no clear preference expressed for either Option A (Bates College) or Option B (Middlebury College). However, the author does mention that they are looking for a school that is more laid-back and mentions that Bowdoin or Bates would offer more non-outdoorsy activities due to their location. Therefore, I would say that there is an equal preference for both options.\n\nSo, the appropriate response would be:\n\n\"Equal preference.\"",
