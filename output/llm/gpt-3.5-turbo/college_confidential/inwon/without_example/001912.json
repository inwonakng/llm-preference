However, the comment provides some information about the University of Alabama, such as its record high enrollment, high ACT scores of incoming students, and the fact that UA graduates are accepted into prestigious law schools like Harvard, University of Virginia, and Vanderbilt. \n\nSince no explicit preference is expressed, we can conclude that there is no strict preference between Option A and Option B.
