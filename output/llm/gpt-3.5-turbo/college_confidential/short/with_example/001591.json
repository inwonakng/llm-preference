For what it is worth \u2026 the data is compiled from linked pages and probably isn\u2019t complete. Moreover, the data could indicate self-selection above anything else (more NU students are inclined towards business and law, or for other options, whereas more Rice students are inclined towards medicine).  ```\n"
