Although she should also fully understand that having decided not to go through the cycle as a recruit,  the coaches may have obligations to players who did (at least for this year) so she should make sure she knows where she stands with them (which it sounds like where she is with Midd.)  It sounds like Haverford is in the sweet spot. These schools all have different environments.  How did they feel to her? If she goes to H, can she do a semester/year elsewhere (abroad) in marine biology?  ```\n"
