It is located not too far from the busy Interstate 95 highway corridor. UR\u2019s campus is in the sprawling suburbs of Richmond, about 10 mins. from downtown areas, including the very fun Carytown area, which is popular with students. There is lots of shopping, grocery stores, good access to medical care, etc. in the surrounding areas. Richmond and its suburbs are certainly smaller and less populous than Philly and its suburbs, but hardly rural. Areas west of Richmond, heading towards the mountains in Shenandoah and the Charlottesville area where UVA is located are much more rural. That area is lovely with lots of farms, vineyards, parks and hiking, scenic views. Richmond has 2 Amtrak rail stops, 1 downtown and 1 in the suburbs, which many UR students use. Richmond also has an international airport, although not gigantic, and the campus has shuttles available to accommodate student travel for breaks. UR runs also shuttle buses to several shopping areas as well as to downtown Richmond. Students also use Uber ride sharing to get around, and many students have cars on campus, since parking is plentiful and inexpensive (although a car is not necessary, neither of my UR grads had one).  ```\n"
