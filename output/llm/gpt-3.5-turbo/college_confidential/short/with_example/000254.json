So PSU would be about $10k-$13k less expensive per year, or about $40-50k less expensive over the course of four years. I think PSU has a slightly stronger Engineering rep than VA Tech and NC State, though all are adequate. So to me, I would choose PSU unless you fell in love with NC State or VA Tech to the point that the $40-$50k difference became a non-factor. Still, that\u2019s a lot of money which you could use for a house down payment, grad school, traveling, investing, etc.  ```\n"
