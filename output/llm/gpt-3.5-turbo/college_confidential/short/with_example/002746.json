On that basis, in my own anecdotal experience, Cornell is a very highly represented school, above most colleges in general, Michigan and many other top schools.  Part of that is simply location and perpetuation through alumni networking.   Many of the quantitative reseach jobs are in NYC, and Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Columbia, Penn and others have an advantage in that respect.   Nobody would turn away a Michigan applicant who really wants to be in this industry, but we see less applicants. Same could be said for Caltech.  We see more MIT applicants, does not mean Caltech is a lesser school than MIT.  ```\n"
