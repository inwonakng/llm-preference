Obviously Stanford is the most successful Division I athletics in the country and there are some consequences tied to that. There are \u2018classes\u2019 for each Varsity sport. Will you be expected to max out the 8 credits available in ATHLETIC 28? Will your Athletic Advisor steer you to easier courses and easier majors so you can focus more on rowing? Is having access to less rigorous courses important because I believe you\u2019ll find more at Stanford than you will at Princeton. All Princeton UGs have to do research and produce a Thesis along with other papers to build up to that. Is that something that appeals to you or not? I think that one thing that is always asked of an Athlete is would you be happy at the school if you were injured and could no longer participate in your sport or if the current coach left?  ```\n"
