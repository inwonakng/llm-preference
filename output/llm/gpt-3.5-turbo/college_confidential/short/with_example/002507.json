At MHC, you would have more seminars and student participation as well as faculty who would notice how well you are doing and whether you are learning or not. McGill is cheaper and much better known outside the US but your education would be much more up to you. MHC probably would have better mental health services as well. You are likely to end up back in your home country, BTW. Though it may be easier to stay in Canada than the US. What are goals? Mods really should move this to the International Students forum.  ```\n"
