That\u2019s completely false. My D is at UGA and many of her friends got internships and full time jobs in NY with companies like Deloitte. If they wanted NYC, they got it. Many want to stay in Atlanta. So if you want to go to NY, those opportunities will be there. Terry is an excellent business school and will not hold you back. Their placement is excellent. IU, while an excellent business school, does not offer significantly better opportunities than UGA. My D turned down a full ride at IU for UGA and has no regrets whatsoever and has not seen any difference in business school quality as a practical matter (and not based on rankings).  She has a tippy top internship lined up for next summer. Choose the school that is the better fit, go there, and be excellent. Btw, while Terry is competitive entry, most students have no trouble getting their first choice major. Look at the admissions requirements and educate yourself about what is involved. Entry isn\u2019t difficult.  ```\n"
