On the other hand, a candidate for a Ph.D. program should be fully funded, that is, the university waives the student\u2019s tuition, and will pay them a (sometimes barely) living stipend, with the student having to work as a TA in exchange. Kenyon is about an hour away from Columbus, so that coordination program sounds like it would be perhaps once a week, and a student would need a car if the school does not provide van or other transportation for participating students. An email to the administrative assistant for the Psych dept, asking who would be best equipped within the department to answer questions about preparation for grad school and past track record for grad school admission, would be a way to get the OP\u2019s questions in front of someone with knowledge.  The other approach is to email the Chair of the department directly, but sometimes those emails can get lost in the shuffle.  We found that contacting the support staff for the department often meant they pointed us in the direction of the person who would be most responsive. I would also recommend a more detailed conversation with Financial Aid, asking about what might happen to aid if parent relocates etc. Congrats to the OP\u2019s daughter on her wonderful options!  ```\n"
