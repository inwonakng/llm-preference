[/quote]  The best-known college-rankings, from USN&WR, include an evaluation of \u201cstudent selectivity\u201d (among other things). And as far as USN&WR is concerned, acceptance rate is only a minor factor in determining selectivity. They evaluate selectivity using the following factors: 65% weight - SAT or ACT scores for enrolled (not admitted) students 25% weight - fraction of enrolled (not admitted) students in top 10% of their high school class 10% weight - acceptance rate In other words, \u201cselectivity\u201d is not really determined by the number of students that a school turns away. Instead, it\u2019s mostly determined by the quality of the students that a school attracts. In the 2018 ranking, BC was ranked #28 for selectivity specifically, while BU was ranked #45. Note that these are just the ranks for selectivity, which is only one component of the overall ranking. BU ranked higher than BC in other components, like \u201cfaculty resources\u201d, and so the overall rankings were closer. So there is a good case that BC is the more \u201cselective\u201d school. However, it would be foolish to choose BC over BU solely on that basis.  ```\n"
