Costs outside of tuition will be approx 20k. That leaves 5k for you of which you can easily pay for with a combination of summer jobs and a small loan in your name (I believe you can get 5500, 6500, 7500, 7500 over four yrs. Vandy is an excellent school for your academic interests. It is chock full of brilliant kids so you will have that \u201cHarvard type\u201d experience, and it is known for having very happy students (per the quality if life rankings). Being a super selective school (15% category), Vandy will also help satify any prestige issues you may be dealing with. Tough to say no to Harvard. Congrats on your admissions choices. Incredible job. ```\n"
