However, the harsh reality in today\u2019s job market (ok, in any generation\u2019s job market), prestige matters. JHU and CalTech are ranked up there with the Ivies and certain corporations will only hire from what they consider \u201celite\u201d universities.  In addition, let\u2019s say your son doesn\u2019t want to do BME after exploring that field.  Google, Goldman, Mckinsey would be happy to talk to him if he goes to JHU or CalTech.  It would be possible from G-Tech, but harder for sure.  Call these firms snobs if you want, but it\u2019s their money.  ```\n"
