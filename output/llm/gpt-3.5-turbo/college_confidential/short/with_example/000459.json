While college is not like a car or a house its the same principal do you want money left over or not.  Do you buy the most you can qualify for or do you save the money?  UGA is an excellent school and as in state student you pay no tuition with the zell.  If something were to happen to a parents employment or its a difference of their retirement it does come into play.  If 100k does not matter to a family that is one thing but to many that is alot of money especially when there are multiple children to educate.  Then there is grad school to consider.  Or down the road a possible large down payment on a house if not spent for education.  ```\n"
