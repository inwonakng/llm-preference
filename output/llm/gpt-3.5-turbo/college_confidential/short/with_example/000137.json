I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re getting all your misinformation. But, remember, you can\u2019t take the Wharton classes you wanted when you were rejected. Haverford seems like it will satisfy your need to associate yourself with Penn, even if you can\u2019t take the classes you\u2019d really want, so go there. Scholardad hit the nail on the head!  ```\n"
