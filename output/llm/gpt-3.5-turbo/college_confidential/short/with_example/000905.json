Got into Chicago, Dartmouth, Brown as well as some great LAC\u2019s. He chose USC , graduated with honors and was one of only 10 students who received Discovery Scholars 10K awards for grad school. He just received his PhD from CalTech, the most prestigious grad U in the world, also at no cost. His intention all along was to go to CT for grad school, and USC helped make that happen. He never regretted going to USC. He found his \u201cpeeps\u201d in the small Honors Science and Humanities classes, was able to do funded research all 4 years, and  he wants to go back to be a professor. You graduate will be treated like Gold at USC. And there is Nothing like being able to wear shorts and sandles all year long, lol!  ```\n"
