However, I often do warn that it is too teeny./limited (85 grads per hear) for most students.    If you want a more traditional college experience, GT may be better.   For completeness I will add more info about Olin too. Olin grads do have decent prospects for internships and jobs.  The job fairs I think have more companies than annual graduates.   You may find this link helpful - http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/careers-graduate-studies/results/.    There will definitely be employers who have NOT heard of Olin, more so as you get further from Boston.   The various rankings can help mitigate that - http://www.olin.edu/about/rankings-awards/ Olin does have many projects, especially compared to my Engineering program in 1980s.    It also has intense academics, but not in the traditional course sequences.   Many Olin admits are highly qualified - some have turned down offers MIT, Stanford, Princeton etc.  So there is a presumption that they already have a lot of AP/IB knowledge under their belt. Our son did do research at Olin (including the summer after Freshman year), but it was interwined with software engineering.  One project resulted in an award (with colleges that had more liberal arts kinds of CS than most STEM schools).  He also did poster presentation at a conference.  But these things were not due to intentional research focus - he intended to go to work, not grad school. The first link above includes To grad schools s  (the qty may be out of  all grads to date - under 1000\u2026 and I think a minority apply to grad schools) Harvard University  25 Stanford 21 MIT  20 Carnegie Mellon University 18 University of California Berkeley 15 Cornell 12 Olin students can also take classes at Babson (adjacent campus), Wellsley (campus loop bus), or Brandeis. I think the approach to have an Olin Candidate\u2019s Weekend  is wise.  (first cut of admits come to campus on one of 3 weekends) .    I was not able to attend, but DH (also an engineer) went. with DS\u2026 and after that, they both were smitten. In Summary:  Olin can be a fine school if it is a good \u201cfit\u201d.    But it is a niche-fit, so students should careful study the pros/cons for their particular situation.  ```\n"
