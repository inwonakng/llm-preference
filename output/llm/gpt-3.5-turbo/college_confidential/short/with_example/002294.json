UMich is not even he best public US university out there UCB is widely recognized as the best public.\u201d Your logic is flawed. I never claimed that Michigan is the best public university, and I would agree that that honor goes to Cal. Michigan is a close second, along with UCLA and UVa. But so what if Michigan is not considered the best public university in the nation? Columbia is not even recognized as one of the top 5 private universities. That distinction goes to Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Stanford and Yale. You are again insinuating that private universities are better than public universities, which is a prejudiced and elitist point of view. And I am not stating opinion when I say that Columbia and Michigan are peer institutions. Our opinions hardly matter. I am stating fact. All legitimate academic reputation ratings published by academe that I have seen suggest that Columbia and Michigan are peer institutions. All industry placement reports I have seen also suggest that Michigan and Columbia are equally respected. If you have evidence to the contrary, feel free to share.  ```\n"
