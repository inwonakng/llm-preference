He says the drop out rate from engineering is too high and because it is so large S can easily get lost. [/quote]  Decades ago, many state flagships (probably including Maryland) were not as selective as they are now.  Because engineering curricula were and are rigorous, the washout rate was high back then as many less prepared students decided it was too hard. But a strong student of the type to earn a full ride merit scholarship is likely to be one who can handle the rigor of an engineering curriculum.     Roark345: [quote] Brother says to send S to CMU where the class size is much smaller and a lot more attention is given from the professors. [/quote]  How much is your brother offering to contribute?  The decision really belongs to whoever is attending and whoever is paying.  ```\n"
