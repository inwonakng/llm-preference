My S is finishing up his freshman year of engineering at VT. He was rejected by Cornell. We were disappointed at the time, but in hindsight it was lucky. VT is the right place for him. He made the 3.0 GPA cut for guaranteed choice of engineering major next year at VT, with room to spare. Your D will not have a problem. If it\u2019s not too late, she should apply for Hypatia. I was worried that Galileo might be engineering overkill for my S, but he has thoroughly enjoyed it and took advantage of all the opportunities that came with the program. They\u2019re all in it together. Highly recommended. Your whole family will love the VT experience. Let\u2019s Go Hokies!  ```\n"
