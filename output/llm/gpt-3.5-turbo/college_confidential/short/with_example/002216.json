One of the best parts of being a great athlete is having these choices (and decision) early. You are able to relax (while keeping up your training and studies) while everyone else is sweating the college apps and decisions. It\u2019s pretty sweet. It sounds like the only issue with Stanford is being bored with it being familiar.  It is fantastic to be on a winning sports program if you are investing all the time to be part of one. You said Stanford is at the top of the heap. Don\u2019t underestimate how fast training indoors for a west coast athlete can get old. Being part of a huge (not just big) budget athletic program has perks mere mortals never see\u2026higher level of travel comfort, competitive and training opportunities - some in other countries, academic support (a tutor) on the plane with you, as much gear as you can imagine, the best trainers brought in from all over the world, custom footwear - crazy stuff, but things that help you excel as an athlete and student. You are going to spend a lot of hours with this team and coach (coaches can change, but you likely have general idea of longevity if coach is a fixture there, but certainly the team), do you have a feeling of a fit with the guys/team culture at one or the other? From everything you have said, Stanford has more to offer you except a different coast and new experience. But it could be a new experience that is life changing for the better, or frankly it could be a bust. It is up to you to make either choice the experience you want it to be. It is ok to turn down Stanford, there are plenty of athletes that choose other schools for various reasons that are important to them. It is your life. Just be sure you are doing so based on significant reasons that are important to you. If your gut is not clearly ringing a loud bell then write down what is really important or matters in your choice - academics, athletic prestige, academic prestige, importance of winning, importance of winning level (NCAA Champion potential), coaches, team mates, location, family support nearby, big budget program, weather, size of school, support of athletes - anything at all that matters. Then prioritize them for you. Put the winner in one column and see which school has the most \u201cvictories.\u201d Sometimes it is good to separate out factors that are all jumbled in your head and causing confusion. It can help you see what is important to you. And as a last thought, I always suggest students ask themselves this question\u202610 years from now, where do you want to say you graduated from? I assume you have until the November 8th-15th NLI period, which means someone has to be readying the paperwork now/very soon, so perhaps you have made your decision? Best to you!  ```\n"
