That\u2019s a CMU education or a UMD education and $3,000,000 when he turns 58. That\u2019s the true difference when you consider the opportunity cost of the money ($270,000 at 6% annually for 40 years). Alternatively, it\u2019s $1,500,000 at age 48. It would be a nice bridge between an early retirement and his fully funded 401k at 59.5. He might get a slightly better experience at CMU, maybe even a superior experience. What he won\u2019t get though is an experience that\u2019s even remotely close to $270,000 more valuable financially. You all have to decide if you are flush enough to provide that as a gift simply based on the experience. It\u2019s unfortunately too late for this option now for you, but we had a plan for just this case. Not believing ANY undergraduate degree from ANY school is worth a quarter of a million dollars, we simply told our son that any program that netted out over $200k was off the table. The only schools he applied to, in addition to meeting all the requirements that he wanted out of a school, were schools that had reputations of granting good merit aid to high stats students. Tough choice, but the financial implications are real.  ```\n"
