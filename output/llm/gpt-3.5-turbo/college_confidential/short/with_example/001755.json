We also understand how long we have to work to save up $260K after tax and what that type of money really means (roughly $2M by retirement, given conservative return assumptions).  Also, employers will read resumes and know if he got one of those special named scholarships at UMich (he would certainly be free to state that he got the full ride to UMich and note how rare that is on is resume). As you may have guessed, I actually consider that to be more impressive than a mere HYPSM degree. Note that lay people don\u2019t hire.  Hiring managers hire.  ```\n"
