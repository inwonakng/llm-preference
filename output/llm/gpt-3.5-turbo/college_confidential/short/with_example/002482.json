The Stanford campus is huge, and  removed from town.  Students don\u2019t live off campus or hang out off campus.  In fact, students rarely leave campus at all except to go on outings to San Francisco or maybe to the movies. tl/dr  Palo Alto has almost nothing in common with Ann Arbor, Madison, Cambridge or Hyde Park (but the weather is far nicer).  ```\n"
