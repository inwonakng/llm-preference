For many international students, an American degree is prestigious.  Specifically, I read an article where certain Chinese families (the ones who can afford to do so, of course, which is a tiny sliver of the population) desperately want their children to attend an American college or university. Any American college or university! The OP can speak to whether this is true in HK.  But if you\u2019ve ever wondered why there are so many international students at all sorts of American schools (not just elite ones; right now, there are international students attending\u2013oh, I don\u2019t know\u2013Western Michigan U.), you have your reason.  The desire to study in America, coupled with the prestige conferred by a degree from an American school, attracts many bright students from outside the US.  ```\n"
