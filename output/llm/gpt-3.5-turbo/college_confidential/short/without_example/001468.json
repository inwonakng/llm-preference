The types of close relationships with professors that she will be able to develop at a place like Kenyon will be unmatched at a large, public university. These relationships, in turn, will translate into better recommendations and more support. Does she need to major in a STEM field to maintain her status as a STEM Scholar? Why not see how she is doing health-wise before you start moving across country?  ```\n"
