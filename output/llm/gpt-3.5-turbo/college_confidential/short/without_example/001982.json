Amazing food on 9th street near east campus and known as a culinary incubator.  Lots of creative chefs taking advantage of the research triangle.  The city of Durham also had some great food ranging from tapas to oven gourmet pizza.  Also home to the Durham Bulls. The good news is with 6,000 kids on 8,000 plus acres of campus there is plenty of room for Duke students to spread out.  By comparison UCB has 29,000 undergrads on 1,232 acres. Lastly I was in Oakland 25 years ago and felt very unsafe.  Has it changed and how did the riots several months ago effect the students experience.  Just asking.  ```\n"
