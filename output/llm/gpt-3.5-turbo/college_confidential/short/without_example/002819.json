At Bates, Lewiston is not as cute, but you can easily walk to places from campus. Hamilton is about 10 miles from Utica and 40 miles from Syracuse. I think you will get better answers to your questions regarding locale, activities nearby, and community service, by asking Hamilton students when you visit next week.  ```\n"
