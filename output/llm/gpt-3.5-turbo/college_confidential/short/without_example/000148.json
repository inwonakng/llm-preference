Your ECs are impressive, so I doubt that has been/will be an issue for acceptances. I don\u2019t know the detail and rigor of your HS courses, but your ACT score is below the 25% level for several of the schools you applied to. Fordham and Babson acceptances are higher probability than the rest of the schools on your list, and most of the rest I would classify as high reaches (with Villanova a reach). Don\u2019t fret over decisions until you are faced with them\u2026if you need summer earnings to pay for college, I would choose Pitt over Smeal summer\u2026but only you can make these decisions. Good luck, keep us updated.  ```\n"
