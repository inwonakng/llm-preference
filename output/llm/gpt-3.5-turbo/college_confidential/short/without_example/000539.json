      "content": "College A: ```University of Rochester```\nCollege B: ```Emory University```\nComment: ```Emory and Rochester are basically peer institutions, slight differences in rankings, acceptance rates, and medical school placement notwithstanding.  Both are excellent schools with lots of clinical and research opportunities convenient to the main undergrad campus. And both are rigorous and respected without being known for cut-throat academics or grade deflation (or inflation, either, for that matter).  But, yes, you\u2019ll also find \u201cweed out\u201d courses at both schools as well. Remember, too, MOST students do not go to undergrad and med school at the same institution.  So, size of med school class or reserved places for REMS is sort of immaterial.  Some of the best schools for pre-meds are LACs that have no direct ties to med school but provide excellent education and good pre-med advising. Conventional advice for pre-meds is to make sure that they pay attention to COA, since they will have several more years of schooling after undergrad to consider in terms of finances.  ```\n"
