I remember you posting when you had a good but not great ACT score, and you loved SC then. When you made that big improvement, it opened up some other options, but it also made you a great candidate for SC Honors College. Michigan is a great school, but it seemed like your heart was in SC right from the start. Go and enjoy, especially for those months when it\u2019s freezing at home but relatively balmy in Columbia.  ```\n"
