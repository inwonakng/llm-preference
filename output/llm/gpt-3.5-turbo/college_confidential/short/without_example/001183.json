I\u2019d call them a semi target. They also do well in the mutual fund business and finance in general. Boston is a major finance center and all of the major IB firms have local offices as well as recruit to NYC. Go on Linkedin and look at the alumni. Also go on Wall St Oasis and search for BC. I think it\u2019s recruited as heavily if not more than UNC. Both great schools in great places. Where do you want to live? East coast has many different flavors.  ```\n"
