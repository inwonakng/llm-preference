However, the academic intensity is high (regardless of major), and the large core curriculum (including HSA requirements) means that cherry picking courses that you are most likely to get A grades in is more difficult. In contrast, Amherst has no general education requirements, which means that you can cherry pick courses that you are most likely to get A grades in to boost your GPA for pre-med purposes.  But there is no native engineering degree program. You can do pre-med as an engineering major at many schools, but the high volume of non-overlapping requirements for most types of engineering and pre-med course requirements can make it difficult to fit all of the course work into four academic years of normal course loads.  Adding intercollegiate athletic workload makes that even more difficult.  ```\n"
