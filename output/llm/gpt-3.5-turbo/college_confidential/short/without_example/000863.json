Both institutions offer more than enough opportunities for the student to pursue a variety of careers in business, entrepreneurship, etc. What would make the difference is the extent to which the student immerses himself in the many opportunities available at both institutions. And so perhaps the deciding factor would be how the student perceives the environment at the two institutions. References to alum who are celebrities in business and other walks of life seem a highly suspect and circum circuitous way to judge an institution.  ```\n"
