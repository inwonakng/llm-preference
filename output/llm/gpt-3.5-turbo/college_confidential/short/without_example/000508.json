The same goes for drugs. You can find them anyplace, but at some schools it may be a little pot, while at others it\u2019s the hard stuff being dealt and imbibed on a much more frequent basis. There are definite differences in drug and alcohol climates at different schools. I\u2019m going to have to disagree with the lovely @Lindagaf on Vassar. V has more economic diversity and is less monied than most of her peers. But I do think her \u2018over earnest\u2019 comment has merit.  ```\n"
