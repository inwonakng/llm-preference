How about your aid at Penn State? Is some of that merit money? Is there a minimum GPA to keep that merit money? Are you afraid that Penn will be too hard? I think that Much2learn had some great ideas on contacting an advisor and preparing for college. Penn State has some huge classes and they won\u2019t be any easier than Penn. At either school, you will need to hit the ground running. Penn would not have admitted you if you weren\u2019t up to the work!!!  ```\n"
