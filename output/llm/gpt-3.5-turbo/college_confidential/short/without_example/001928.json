With plus-minus grades at UA, an A+ being worth 4.33, the top students like you that gets lots of those have an easy time being at or near 4.0.  Every year there are hundreds of President\u2019s List 4.0 grads. The 170 LSAT is not as easy, but not unreasonable.  My brother actually had no intention of law school.  He was getting his MBA, and working at a test prep place to make some money.  He was teaching an LSAT review course.  Decided that if he\u2019s teaching the course, he should take the test for the experience.  He got 175.  Then he said I guess I have to go to law school.  ```\n"
