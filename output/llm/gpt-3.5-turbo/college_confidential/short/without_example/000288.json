Normally VT and Penn St are pretty darn equal in caliber (albeit a general edge toward VT in most areas of engineering), but I\u2019d wonder how the switch from the branch campus would go.  The better students from our high school (heading toward engineering) go straight to main campus.  I\u2019m not sure if those who start at branch campuses end up doing fine or if not.  Those I know personally (who start at branch campuses) aren\u2019t engineering majors.  Can Erie\u2019s branch campus let you know how many start out vs finish?  (Then allow for the fact that there will be those who start and don\u2019t finish at the Main Campus too, of course.)  ```\n"
