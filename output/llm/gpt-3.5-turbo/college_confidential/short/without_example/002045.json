Look at how well Dartmouth ranks in any international ranking, for instance. Or look at how well UIUC and UW-Seattle rank in USNews. Yet those are top schools for CS and engineering. Look at how well A&M and Purdue rank in USNews. Yet those are top schools for engineering. BTW, if she will get a grad degree, pick a cheaper undergrad.  ```\n"
