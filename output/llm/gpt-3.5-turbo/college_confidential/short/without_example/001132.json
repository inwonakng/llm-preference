You must have worked hard for the opportunities. Did you get into Carroll school?  If so and you want to work on east coast in govt or banking my opinion would be BC. If not it\u2019s a toss up. My daughter got into BC and USC but chose USC for the weather . She also had honors college at UF and full scholarship. UF isn\u2019t UNC but it\u2019s a top 10 USNWR public uni like unc.  It\u2019s pretty close. She is premed though not business. If she got into Carroll and not the other schools b schools it would be 100 percent BC  ```\n"
