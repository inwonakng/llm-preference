I am frankly surprised at the strength of Ohio State and the Pac 12\u2026 would have expected more ivies. http://www.ncaa.com/history/rowing/d1 apparently men\u2019s  is  not part of the ncaas\u2026so don\u2019t have the results for that but on the women\u2019s  side I see more rowing depth in the midwest and west coast than the east coast.  ```\n"
