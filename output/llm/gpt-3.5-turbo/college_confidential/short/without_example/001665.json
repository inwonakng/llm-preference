Typically it\u2019s the engineer=engineer manager=engineer directer=VP, etc route. Of course, it\u2019s possible to jump ship and switch from engineering, into sales/marketing/project management/etc and then to a director/executive position in those areas. You don\u2019t have to stay in engineering your whole career, the qualities that made you a good engineer, often translates into other fields, and it\u2019s not uncommon for engineers to make those type of career changes.  ```\n"
