Since my Oliner is a first year I can\u2019t be authoritative on what will happen later. But I have already seen some healthy skepticism about some Olin things (in other words he hasn\u2019t completely drank the Kool-Aid). And when I have seen him hanging with Olin friends they all seem to have a good sense of humor about Olin\u2019s uniqueness. This is not to say they don\u2019t love the culture, it is just that they are self-aware and mature about it. My guess is that for the first couple of years Oliners think and talk about the culture a whole bunch. But by years three and four it is just part of them. I\u2019m not sure if this at all answers what is a very good question.  ```\n"
