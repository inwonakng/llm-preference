In terms of academic strength across the board, Michigan might trail only Berkeley among public schools. Might. And they\u2019re probably better than the rest. Realizing that grad school rankings are not a proxy for undergrad quality \u2013 but if the grad program is strong, chances are the undergrad version is at least pretty good \u2013 Michigan is top-20 in almost everything and top-10 in most things. UCLA and UVA (especially UVA) can\u2019t say that. Columbia is a totally different environment and a great school, but if it is better than Michigan, it isn\u2019t six-figures better.  ```\n"
