With the undergrad degree from Wharton you won\u2019t need the MBA. The total cost of an MBA is ~$170,000. When accounting for the lost wages (assume a decent IB job), then it\u2019s probably around $400,000 after taxes. So NYU + MBA is definitely more expensive, and realistically the Wharton undergrad is more impressive than NYU + MBA in most cases. That said, I would probably just avoid the MBA altogether unless you feel financially comfortable and get into a top program. Penn is also a better school overall, so if you decide finance isn\u2019t for you then you\u2019re better positioned. It\u2019s a tough decision. Good luck either way, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll fund success regardless.  ```\n"
