I wouldn\u2019t bank on merit aid as their stats are pretty similar to Emory\u2019s (Emory just gets higher app. volume).  You would not stand out at either statistically. Also please please please stop asking:  \u201cWhich one will give you the higher GPA?\u201d.  Ain\u2019t nobody GIVING you nothing! It makes you sound like a bad applicant to either who isn\u2019t worried about learning and who believes that getting a higher GPA is a matter of choosing the right elite school.  That makes no sense.  In addition, it is a horrible question because we don\u2019t know what you will major in, the courses and professors you would take at each, and how they will grade.  We don\u2019t know, so stop asking. Leave your confusion behind on the medical school admit rates.  You either have a great application or you don\u2019t.  If you went to a state school with a 35% rate but were excellent versus the rest of the student body and your performance reflected it, you would very likely get in unless you can\u2019t interview well.  There are so many things that affect these numbers that you need to just stop being confused, visit places and choose somewhere you actually fit, and do well.  That is how you get to your next destination.  These percentages have nothing to do with what YOU and your situation and performance will be.  Either take that to heart or remain confused and go to Rochester or wherever else. You already asked about competition and I don\u2019t know anything about UR\u2019s academic environment.  Emory\u2019s was already answered. Your thing about weed-out is just false (UR has engineering, and engineering curricula everywhere and especially at selective schools are very challenging, but that has nothing to do with pre-med classes.  From my comparisons of course materials in the life sciences, Emory is among the harder schools ranked between 13 and 25 or so).  Every student at every damned school claims that pre-med courses are weedouts.  If you compared the actual courses between elite schools you would either find out that there is no difference, or that one student body was exaggerating to a ridiculous extent.  If you want to keep saying this with no evidence than hearsay, please avoid Emory because what you \u201cheard\u201d will lead you to a path of misery.   Pre-med is going to be hard at any selective university.  To even try to split hairs between selective schools without seeing course materials is a waste of time so stop doing it.  If you are concerned, choose schools much less selective than either of these and stop saying this part and the stuff about the GPA every time you post.  ```\n"
