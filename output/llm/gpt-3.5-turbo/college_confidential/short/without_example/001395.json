Otherwise, top small liberal arts colleges like Wesleyan provide a really wonderful educational experience for undergraduates, with small classes, lots of opportunities to interact and work closely with professors, and a tight community. But you already have narrowed your decision to two fantastic options using all your criteria. For your final choice, don\u2019t \u201coverthink\u201d the decision. Just pick whichever one feels best to you, commit, and do not look back! If unsure, imagine giving up one school, then imagine giving up the other. Which is harder to say goodbye to? Go there!  ```\n"
