I\u2019ve been there numerous times and think it\u2019s a very nice place. Know a few grads and they are good kids and gainfully employed. But I have no idea where your stats are comming from regarding BC Carroll School of Management low pay and localized around Boston?  That\u2019s utter nonsense. Sorry. A large group of students stay in Boston because Boston is very attractive and New England despite the weather gets a hold of you. So yeah BC is big in Boston. Which also the educational capital of the world. The mutual fund capital, genetics reasesrch and pharmaceutical. And hot tech.  And low pay. I could give you the list of superstar CSOM grads but that would be unnecessary. Congrats on all the great options  Best of luck at UNC and enjoy the great hoops too!  ```\n"
