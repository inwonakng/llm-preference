I am saying that in the real world most people focus on the broader and household name rankings. In every one Duke has an indisputable and substantial edge. I can observe that the disparity between a Duke and UCB engineering degree is much narrower then the broad difference by which Duke surpassses UCB in name recognition, brand respect etc based on the aforementioned rankings.  Consequently, the 17/18 year old OP should be confident that the post college adult doesn\u2019t want to pursue a career outside of engineering.  Again both great schools but Duke clearly is a safer long term option in my opinion.  ```\n"
