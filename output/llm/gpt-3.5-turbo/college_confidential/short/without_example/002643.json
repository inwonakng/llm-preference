GT is not hands down \u201cbetter\u201d than Olin. It\u2019s hands down different. At GT classes will be large, and much of the instruction will be by graduate students. There will be classes at GT that might be bigger than the entire Olin student body. Olin is TINY. They put a big emphasis on an well rounded, integrated process including entrepreneurship and liberal arts. It is definitely a love it or hate it environment. If it\u2019s to your liking, it\u2019s one of the coolest undergraduate programs in the nation. @colorado_mom can add light to the subject.  ```\n"
