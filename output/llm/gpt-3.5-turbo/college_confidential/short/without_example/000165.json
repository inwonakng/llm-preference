What\u2019s your FAFSA EFC? If your family owns a business operation, odds are that NPC aren\u2019t totally accurate - but how much did most NPCs indicate? If your parents\u2019 EFC is not zero and they will contribute zero, you need merit aid. With zero family help, anything above 11k is likely too much, which means you\u2019d need a quick turnaround application \u201cjust in case\u201d. You said your parents don\u2019t value college (although nowadays it\u2019s a signal all employers expect for non minimum job positions) which means they may well hope that your acceptances turn out too expensive and you can\u2019t go. You should apply to Youngstown State and/or UToledo and/or WCU ASAP (like, today, because March is around the corner and honors program+scholarships will soon be gone).  ```\n"
