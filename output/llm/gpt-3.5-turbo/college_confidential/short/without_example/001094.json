For techies, not so much, among new hires at FANG, SJSU beats MIT and U of Phoenix beats Harvard.  Economics/business (OP son\u2019s intended study), at undergrad level, is probably more fuzzy than techie. This question of Stanford/Harvard(full pay) vs USC(or similar schools) full tuition merit is asked multiple times every year on CC. Though the opinion seems to be 10 to 1 in favor of merit I have yet to see a taker of that option.  ```\n"
