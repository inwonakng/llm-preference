That\u2019d be about 25% or so. 20% went straight to graduate school, while the other 55% worked for other companies (Intuit, Cisco, Lyft, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) I\u2019m not sure how these numbers compare to Johns Hopkins\u2019s CS. As previously mentioned, outcomes are not the issue when it comes to CS at Pomona. I\u2019ve seen that repeatedly and have looked enviously at my friends (seems like the easiest path to a six figure salary- straight out of college!)  ```\n"
