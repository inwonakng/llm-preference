GPA inflation IS grade inflation (in fact, studies of grade inflation often use GPA distributions to measure grade inflation, or percentage of As - both of which is high at Brown). Brown and Duke have the same quality of student - yet Duke students have a harder time getting As and higher GPAs. The OP ought to be aware of this to make an educated decision.  In some situations, such as Law School admissions, where GPA heavily influences admissions and the school attended is not sufficiently used to put GPAs in context, a school like Brown might be a strategic choice.  ```\n"
