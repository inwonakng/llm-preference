It seems to me it doesn\u2019t matter that UF sends a lot of kids to medical school for this analysis.  UF is much bigger and sends a smaller percentage.  And a smaller percentage to to top schools.  And I can see a path to going state school if you state medical school is cheap, and that is where you want to go, and the flagship sends a lot of kids.  So, UT austin on a full ride might lead you right to a cheap, but top, texas medical school.  Then your total debt might be minimal.  But that is not the case here unless the plan is to go to a georgia State medical school.  And, even then, I venture, going to harvard would likely result in merit money.  My point overall is that it is way to simplistic, if medical school is in the cards, not to even consider how it will play out with the next, larger, expenditure of 400,000 and the 3% admission rates.  I believe that you are far more likely to get in, and get merit money, coming from Harvard.  In that case, the debt is worth it.  I would say, at a mininum, nobody should simply assume that you can get the same output (cheap medical school), from a different input (GT v.Harvard but should at least look at the cost and stats from each school for medical school.  ```\n"
