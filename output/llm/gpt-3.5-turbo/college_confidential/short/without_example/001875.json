On average, it is not close. \u201cComparable\u201d is just what you say to people who were rejected from Penn to make them feel better. They will get an excellent education at Penn State. However, it is not comparable. You should choose Penn. Based on your questions, I strongly suggest that you contact Penn and work this summer with an advisor to understand as much as possible about Penn. It is an extraordinary place, but you have to know how to study, prepare for classes, how not to get behind and how to capture the benefits of all of the clubs and opportunities it offers. There are more opportunities there than hours in the day. You have no idea right now how much you don\u2019t know. The sooner you begin to understand the opportunity you have and how to fully capture the benefits, the better. If you can do that, you will receive a truly world-class education.  ```\n"
