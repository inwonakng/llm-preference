If you\u2019re interested in participating in research, Pomona will provide extraordinary opportunities, and you will be able to work directly with faculty. You might take a look at the faculty bios in your departments of interest to see what you think of the people you\u2019ll be interacting with. If you\u2019re an ideas person who likes to ask and answer questions and be challenged to develop your own theories, Pomona is a good fit. If you feel comfortable with, and are invigorated by the idea of developing a personal rapport with esteemed faculty, Pomona is a good fit. I still visit with my favorite faculty mentor over 20 years later. The cross-registration is indeed a cool feature of the Claremonts. Each school does have its personality and reputation behind it, but all the schools are strong, selective, and well-resourced, so it\u2019s a powerhouse there. There\u2019s one central main library for all the schools, one campus ministry center, one student health/counseling center, one main bookstore, one student newspaper. Have you visited Claremont? It\u2019s very suburban and not particularly stimulating. You can easily walk to the adjacent \u201cVillage\u201d which has a movie theater, coffee shops, and restaurants, and it\u2019s cute and pleasant but nothing that\u2019s really going to ignite any curiosity or provide a lot of opportunities. The surrounding suburbs are even more ho-hum. So there\u2019s really nothing particularly advantageous about the environs there other than it\u2019s a convenient climate that doesn\u2019t impact your life much except for some days in the fall when you will wish you had air conditioning. But if you don\u2019t love Baltimore, then that\u2019s not a real factor I suppose. In my era, Pomona was relatively weak on career development and tended to send many students to either graduate school for PhDs/academia or med school, and the main supported direct placement into full-time jobs was the management consulting route. There were pockets of weak departments and some use of questionable part-time faculty for classes like calculus \u2013 but that\u2019s old data so not worth much. All the Claremont schools talk about internship opportunities but be aware that \u201cLos Angeles\u201d is a solid hour by train from Claremont, so this resource has some challenges built in. Pomona places a strong emphasis on diversity and most of the community there are students of color. In that, it feels very similar to southern California as a whole, where there\u2019s no one racial majority. It\u2019s the most selective liberal arts college in the nation with a huge endowment. Still, most everyday people on the street will not have heard of it, so if you want that nod of recognition when making small talk, Pomona isn\u2019t the one. Having said all these things, I\u2019d choose Pomona again based primarily on one key principle: it\u2019s devoted to undergraduates. I think it makes sense to attend the school that is all about undergrads when an undergrad, then attend a grad school where grad students are a priority. In all, you\u2019re in a great and enviable position \u2013 congratulations and good luck!  ```\n"
