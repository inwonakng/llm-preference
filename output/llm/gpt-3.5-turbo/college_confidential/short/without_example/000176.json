Then a Pell grant of around $6,000 possibly, and then the Pell match at Pitt of another $6,000. Was the $2,000 a merit scholarship? Then you can borrow $5,500 for the year. You might get federal work study, but that is earned at a work-study job as you go ($70 a week or so during the semester). That\u2019s $23,200 Not nearly enough.  ```\n"
