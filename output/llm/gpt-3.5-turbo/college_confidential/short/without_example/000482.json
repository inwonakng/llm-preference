We just attended Kelley DA day and he shadowed a HH student for the day. We will be attending UGA Honors Admit Day and will meet with Terry for a second time. DA into Kelley is attractive, but Honors at UGA seems to have more opportunities. DS received scholarships from both IU and UGA, with UGA being slightly less per year. He was also accepted into McCombs and UNC, but no merit scholarship making them more $. DS is looking for something more than just a great bus degree, perhaps something with Environmental Science, Public Policy and whatever else he can get his hands on. He is planning on eventually getting MBA.  ```\n"
