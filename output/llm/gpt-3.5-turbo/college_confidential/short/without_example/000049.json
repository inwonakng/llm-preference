[/quote]  The Common Data Sets do not report suicide rates, but they do report 4 and 6 year graduation rates. 4 years 87.6% JHU 78.3% Caltech 39.2% Georgia Tech 6 years 93.9% JHU 89.3% Caltech 85.3% Georgia Tech     judgegregg: [quote] My comment around limitations is around demographics of student base. Caltech pretty much has all Uber merit students of same caliber whereas gatech would have a mix of students given it needs to cater to in state students. [/quote]  On the topic of student demographics, it\u2019s perhaps worth noting that they differ in gender ratios in addition to geographic diversity. That matters to some and doesn\u2019t bother others in the slightest, particularly when the schools of interest vary so greatly in size. YMMV. Georgia Tech: 61.2% men, 38.8% women Caltech: 54.6% men, 45.4% women Johns Hopkins: 49% men, 51% women The schools also differ markedly in class sizes. Unsurprisingly, Georgia Tech has more than a few large classes \u2013 a whopping 26% of its classes have more than 50 students, compared to 10% at JHU and Caltech. Caltech and JHU report that 67% and 74% of their classes have fewer than 20 students, respectively; at Georgia Tech, 39% of classes have fewer than 20 students. Of course, it is always best to check the enrollments in the departments of interest. It does a BME student no good if all of the small classes at his/her university are in departments like German and music.  ```\n"
