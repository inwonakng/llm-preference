Housing is a big deal for Temple since you can\u2019t live near campus. There\u2019s a renovated block then you have to go farther away into the city and of course the nicer apartments aren\u2019t cheap. (There\u2019s why honors students having 4years of guaranteed housing is so important). So, investigate the housing situation. List your exact package at your favorite CA school, temple, and Nebraska. ```\n"
