What criteria did you give him/her when applying to schools in terms of what you were willing/able to contribute? What are her social/intellectual/academic wants and needs? Yes, conventional CC wisdom will tell you to take the money from USC and run. But conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t always provide right answers in every case. My daughter had to make the same choice last year: she was offered full tuition scholarships at USC, Vandy, and Wash U (and others) and had also gotten into HYPS and UChicago (UChicago gave a decent merit and FA combination; HYPS gave very little FA (under 10K) and, of course, no merit. The most important criterion my D had was that she wanted to be around really, really bright kids. Brilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools. USC was not a good fit for my D, despite thinking that it had some interesting programs and seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her \u2013 she would NOT have been happy there). Among her full tuition scholarship options, she liked Wash U. the best. My D, with our unwavering support, chose Stanford and could NOT be happier. To us, it is worth every penny. That said, she is our only child, so we don\u2019t have any more tuitions to pay. We drive old cars and don\u2019t take lavish vacations. My D is not seeking an education as a means to an end \u2013 the only return on investment she seeks (and that we hope for her) is greater knowledge. She will likely end up in a PhD program in the humanities. She loves what she is studying, has had some absolutely amazing and supportive professors, enjoys her fellow students, and finally feels like she has intellectual peers (something she did not have in HS). She has truly found her tribe there and is absolutely, positively 100% certain that she made the right choice. My DH and I are too.  ```\n"
