Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```Companies come to Olin to hire because their students have already demonstrated the ability to start and complete a project to the end in their four years.  They have demonstrated their ability to work in teams, and to have actual project management experience from day one.  How many \u2018traditional\u2019 engineering school students can say they have overseen multiple product development projects by the time they graduate?  This is what companies want.  I dare say the lack of theoretical base has not hurt them one bit as they have done \u2018real world\u2019 engineering work for four years.  This is why companies like Microsoft and Google have been snapping up Olin graduates.  ```\n"
