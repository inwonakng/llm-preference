It won\u2019t make much difference for med school admission. If it\u2019s true that Rice has more grade inflation, it may be better to be a premed there. @robotrainbow I understand that NU is not known to you and it\u2019s easy to generalize based on your own experience. However, people with experience with law schools (T-14 law schools), business schools (consistently top-5), economics programs (consistently top-10 with 4.9 out of 5.0 in PA score), performing arts or journalism would likely know Northwestern. That\u2019s covering a lot of people already even at the undergrad level since econ is usually the most popular major. You mentioned science with Rice; NU actually outranks Rice in most science disciplines and has one of the best chemistry departments in the world. Like it or not, reputation is closely related to graduate programs; when two schools are of the same type (mid-sized private research in this case), the one with better graduate programs by a good margin is going to have more national reputation. There are exceptions such as being an Ivy or an elite Catholic but neither applies to Rice.  ```\n"
