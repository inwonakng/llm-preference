Why ? The Masters in Accounting has become a widespread offering due to the increased hours required for CPA license eligibility. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for an accounting major to get a specialty masters in order to expand their attractiveness to employers ? Also, the Indiana-Kelley MBA is just a one academic year addition\u2013just like a Masters in Accounting\u2013so it is worth investigating even without the typical 3 to 5 years expected by the elite MBA programs. So my question is: What good is a Masters in Accounting for an accounting major beyond getting the additional 30 hours for CPA license eligibility which could be accomplished by earning a specialty masters ?  ```\n"
