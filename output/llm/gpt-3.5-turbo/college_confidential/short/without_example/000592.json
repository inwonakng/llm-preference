If he wants to consider CS - cool things are happening with a new building (because of a 31 million dollar gift from an alumnus). I know high GPA students from UMCP get into absolutely top grad schools (I know of one who went to Stanford for CS PhD, and then spent sometime on faculty of Harvard!). Sergey Brin himself went from CS undergrad to Stanford\u2019s PhD program.  ```\n"
