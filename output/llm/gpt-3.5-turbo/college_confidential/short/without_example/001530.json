If full ride means just tuition is covered, instead of $0, it is everything else you would need/expect to pay over 4 years.  Even if the debt at the end of 4 years is only $60k, the fact is there was another roughly $220k  (or whatever the final differential is vs Madison) spent that could have been saved. If you are definite about med school, it looks like a pretty easy decision unless money is really no issue for your family.  ```\n"
