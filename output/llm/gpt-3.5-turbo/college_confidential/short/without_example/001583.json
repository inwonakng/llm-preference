Both have gorgeous campuses. NW is on the lake while Rice is in the museum district of Houston. Rice will have nicer (not brutally cold) weather in the winter/spring, but NW will have nicer (not brutally hot and humid) weather in the summer/fall. NW has Greek life while Rice does not. Rice has the residential college system. Both have division 1 sports. NW has good spectator sports atmosphere while the Rice students mostly ignore the sports teams. Both are terrific schools.There are plenty of parties at both schools.  You can\u2019t go wrong with either choice.  ```\n"
