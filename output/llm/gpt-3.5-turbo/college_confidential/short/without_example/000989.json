Perhaps I\u2019m misunderstanding the term? [/quote]  My sister went to Miami of Ohio, which was one of the original \u201cPublic Ivies.\u201d My mother never lost an opportunity to mention that to friends and relatives. Now so many schools are tagged, \u201cPublic Ivy\u201d, usually by alumni and parents of alumni, that the term doesn\u2019t mean much anymore.  ```\n"
