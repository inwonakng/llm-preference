They are both two of the best powerhouse research universities in the world. It boils down to which one you feel more right about. In regards to weather, Chicago has the four seasons and winter time really helps build character. Needless to say, Stanford enjoys beautiful weather practically all year round. It\u2019s a tough choice, but it\u2019s an easy choice if you trust your guts. Since you live in the Bay Area, I would challenge myself to go out of my comfort zone and try a new environment to spend the next four years enriching my life of the mind in a world class university just like the one in Palo Alto.  ```\n"
