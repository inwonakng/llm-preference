Lots of kids do and the university widely accepts AP credit unlike private colleges. they are sensitive to the community college kids who transfer in and others who financially need to get it done in 3 years. My Berkeley student took summer classes and with AP could have been done in 3 years. I told her to take the extra year as she\u2019ll be working the rest of her life.  ```\n"
