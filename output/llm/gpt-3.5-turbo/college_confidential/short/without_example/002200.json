It\u2019s probably easier for some kids to do a ton of PSETs and bang out a bunch of lab reports than it is for them to write a 15-page research paper and vice versa. Then there\u2019s the issue of graduation/gen ed requirements and how those can be met, whether or not there is a core curriculum, etc. Also, bear in mind that there are theses and there are theses. One of the things my D looked at in comparing two schools within a consortium were the quality of the senior theses of each of the schools (they were available online through the library). Overall, there was a significant difference in the length and quality of the work from the students at one school versus the other. She also noted differences in the levels of intellectual curiosity among the student bodies that she perceived inside and outside of the classroom among the many schools she visited. Overall, you are probably correct about rigor floors and ceilings\u2026the college experience (and life) is often what you make of it; it can be as banal or as rich as the person living it.  ```\n"
