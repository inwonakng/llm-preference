My son goes to Cal Poly. It\u2019s the only program he knows. He takes for granted the class experiences he gets as typical of everywhere, but they aren\u2019t. His school has a lab for every engineering class. They have 5 wind tunnels in their fluids lab, a rotational dynamics and vibrations lab, all in all over 80 dedicated engineering only labs. It\u2019s their unique thing. Olin has it\u2019s unique thing. At the end of the day, they will all mint new engineers who can talk the talk and work the work. How you personally get there is a matter of choice. Just remember, if a student gets jaded about the their program, they probably haven\u2019t been at another to know how special their situation is.  ```\n"
