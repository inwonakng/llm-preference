In the US, it\u2019s not necessarily \u201ceasily walkable\u201d, not necessarily \u201canimated at all times\u201d, not necessarily \u201cexcellent train/bus system/ public transportation\u201d, however it does mean high rises, parks, lots of restaurants, businesses, etc. Depending on where you\u2019re from, you may want to explore that more explicitely. NYC or Boston are very different from Dallas, Austin, or Bloomington. Each has advantages and disadvantages. Note: ask whether dorms have A/C. Has she been admitted to Honors at any of those?  ```\n"
