I think you may be limited in the number of Wharton classes you can take but I know for an absolute fact that you can take Wharton classes\u2013off the top of my head I can think of five Haverford students in the past couple years who have done it (and these are only the people I know, I am sure there are many more). I wouldn\u2019t really choose Haverford based solely on the ability to take classes at Penn and Wharton but if you like Haverford anyway then I think it\u2019s a plus.  ```\n"
