Whether one wishes to label this as \u201cproactive\u201d or \u201creactive\u201d, it is important to applaud the efforts & concern of the Kenyon College administrative staff, professors and students as reflected in the: Report of the Alcohol Task Force Kenyon College March 2017. The above report is available pursuant to a Google search.  ```\n"
