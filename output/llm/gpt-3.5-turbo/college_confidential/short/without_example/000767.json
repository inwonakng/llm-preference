They\u2019ve heard of Hopkins because of the med school, but they will call it \u201cJohn Hopkins\u201d until your ears bleed.  Once you go to grad school, it will be the reputation of the grad school that will matter anyway, other than the occasional person who will bond over the undergrad school because they or someone in their family went there too. There are reasons you might want to choose Hopkins over Pomona, but the name recognition isn\u2019t a great reason IMHO.  Neither school is lacking anything vis-a-vis reputation.  ```\n"
