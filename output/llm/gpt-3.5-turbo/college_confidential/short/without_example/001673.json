Translates to .11 acre per student. Duke 6,449 undergrads on 8,600 acres or 1.33 acres per student. Now on a serious note all preseason college basketball surveys have Duke #1-3. Only time Michigan appears in top 25 is when followed by the word State. [/quote]   As my friend who's a Penn State alum said to me just yesterday, who cares about \"\"those (basketball, hockey) sports.\"\"  =))  When was the last time Duke got a 110,000 people at a football and/or basketball game? Who made the Final Four and lost to Villanova, clearly the best team in college basketball? And yes, I know all about the best high school recruiting class in history, but Kentucky's is pretty darn close too. And Villanova will be back.   Disclaimer: I\u2019m not an alum of either school, just a sports fan, trying to lighten up another rankings thread.   My apologies to the OP.  ```\n"
