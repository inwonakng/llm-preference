They feel that personal safety is no more of an issue at Vandy than most college campuses. None of them have had issues, or had close friends with issues. Interestingly, of the ones that I asked, the daughters all cited a particular incident that they had heard of, but were not involved with. For most girls at college the biggest risk is not strangers, but guy students (who pretty much never think of themselves as bad guys!). In some ways that makes it harder for girls to get their head around, b/c there of the implicit trust of a fellow student. There are a lot of conversations to be had there before she goes to college- no matter where she goes. And no matter how savvy she thinks she is. When the swoon-worthy student in your study group drops by your dorm room to talk about a class project, it\u2019s hard to believe that their understanding of the relationship could be that different than yours- or how badly it can end (recent experience of a friend\u2019s daughter at a different university).  ```\n"
