My daughter has mentioned some crazy money stories but that doesn\u2019t have much, if any, impact on study habits.  She\u2019s also mentioned lots of stories of bargain shopping, kids with campus jobs, \u201cfree\u201d stuff, and the normal spending habits of students on a budget.  If they go out on the weekends, etc. she is not spending a lot of money and there are plenty of opportunities on campus for entertainment that require no money.  ```\n"
