And you can\u2019t work in the summer and much of the aid is loan based, if any.  Log onto the medical school sites to see the tution now.  Now, I firmly reject the advice that you should invariably go for the cheaper school, because the primary basis to reduce medical school costs is to get into a highly competitive low cost school (Baylor) or a free medical school (Case Western speciality school) or an MD Ph.D or merit money.  So, if you are choosing between Yale and Alabama, go to Yale.  Yale is far more likely to get you a low cost medical school.  But here, there is no discernible basis to think that Vanderbilt/Northwestern split, whatever it might be, would result in a better shot at merit money in medical school.  And both would give you a fighting shot at one of the low cost options.  I would absolutely bank the money from the CV scholarship to pay for over a third of medical school and if you are fortunate enought to get merit money or something similar, you might be able to go almost free.  Good luck. One more point, I did not appreciate until recently how crazy medical school admissions and finances are, despite having ample reason to know.  Although you need to enjoy the college experience, going to medical school does require a four year plan, including knowing how you are going to get in (many admission rates are sub-5%, that is, as hard to get in as Harvard undergraduate) and how you are going to pay those big bucks.  It is worth logging onto the medical school websites to realize that they do count parental income, even for a 26 year old \u201cchild\u201d.  On the other hand, not to be too much of a pessimist, right now is an amazing time to be involved in medicine and the journey, well expensive and difficult is worth it if it is your dream.  ```\n"
