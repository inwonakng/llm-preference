Either a 32 ACT score & top 7.5% of high school class, or 34 ACT score & top 10% of one\u2019s high school class. The benefits regarding advising, class registration, special courses & housing can be substantial if one takes advantage of all that is available to them as honors students. In my opinion, the most impact is made during one\u2019s freshman year. You are in the Honors College at IU, but not at UGA. In your sophomore year, as a business major, you may should eligible for Business Honors at IU. Very important for internships, job placement, advising & teacher recs. At UGA you are neither a Foundation Fellow nor a member of the Honors College. AT IU. your 32 ACT score just made the minimum cutoff for the Hutton Honors College. The students with whom you associate while in business school can be important\u2013especially with respect to joining business clubs that match your interests & result in internship & job placement interviews.  ```\n"
