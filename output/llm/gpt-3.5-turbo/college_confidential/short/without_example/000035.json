But remember its only 600 undergrads. Those kiddos almost all get PhDs. Caltech is a school of geniuses and a few drop outs and a few that commit suicide as they cannot keep up.\u201d This does not mean they will all be good engineers. In fact, when my son was looking, one of my patients (the manager of one of NASA\u2019s most famous programs, dual PhD in Physics and Math, and Caltech prof) told me that some of the Caltech engineers he hired for that program were pretty pedestrian and that some of his best engineers were from Podunk U. Just because they teach brutally fast does not mean they are good at teaching students the art of solving practical engineering problems. Two retired Caltech profs told him that if his goal was to be a practicing engineer, not to consider Caltech. Looking at JPLs Executive Council members with tech rolls (non-HR, etc.), none were educated at Caltech. Their schools in no particular order, representing both undergrad and graduate degrees are: Texas A&M, Sam Houston State, Cal Poly, Cal Poly Pomona, UCLA, Texas, MIT, Colorado, Washington, Toronto, USC and Purdue. Engineering is VERY egalitarian. There are no magic schools where everyone is guaranteed success.  ```\n"
