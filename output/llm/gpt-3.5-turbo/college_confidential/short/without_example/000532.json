Our tour guides talked about the parties, talked about stumbling across campus as security would call out their name, \u201cyou okay XXXX\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d as they went back to their rooms. All the LAC except the very Christian LAC (expelled if caught dry campus) had a big drinking or dug/drinking culture. The only other schools that did not seem to were commuter type schools like UTD. They are adults and will have to make their own choices. Good luck to all.  ```\n"
