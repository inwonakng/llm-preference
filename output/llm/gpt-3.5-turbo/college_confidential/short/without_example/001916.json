Of course, those issues have more to do with discipline and motivation than knowledge. I think discussion settings are where large differences in scholastic ability might come out. Another place is in the grading curve. (Though in that case, the kid with lower stats can work hard and achieve strong grades too. Dedication can make up some of that ability gap. But in discussions, sometimes you have to change on the fly, and the difference in ability can become apparent.)  ```\n"
