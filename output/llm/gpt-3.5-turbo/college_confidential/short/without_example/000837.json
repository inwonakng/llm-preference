That said my student at Brown received funding for their business idea through some entrepreneurship program and there has been a lot start-up stuff on campus. Advising and summer program placement has also been above and beyond what we knew about before hand. Housing is not great though, so if really nice dorms is a deal breaker\u2026  ```\n"
