I highly doubt you can earn $75,000 in the summer.  $7,500 maybe if you are very lucky.  You can only borrow $5500 your freshman year.  Your parents would have to borrow or cosign loans for the remainder.  Most outside scholarships are competitive, are for small amounts, and are not renewable.  The best aid, whether merit or need-based, comes from the colleges/universities themselves.  ```\n"
