Any computer engineering curriculum is going to be challenging.  Since you have already  let him know you can help with grad study if he picks UMD, this may be something you will just have to let him decide. I hope he picks UMD since picking the others could impact his finances down the line.  He has a great opportunity to receive an education from a wonderful university for free!  He is very lucky. Good luck with the decision.  ```\n"
