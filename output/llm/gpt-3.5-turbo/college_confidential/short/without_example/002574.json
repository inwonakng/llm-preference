[/quote]  The community of fellow physics students (and of STEM students generally) is going to be significantly larger at Carleton than at Amherst. In the Class of 2016, for example, a Carleton physics major had 25 other physics students in his or her class, while an Amherst physics major had 6. This seems like it would be a noticeable difference. A larger physics community doesn\u2019t automatically make Carleton a better choice \u2013 the whole point of LACs, after all, is that smaller can be better. However, it is a difference that will affect the undergraduate experience of a physics major, and which is therefore worthy of consideration.  ```\n"
