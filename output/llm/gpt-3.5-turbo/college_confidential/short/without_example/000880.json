With the uptick in apps and lowering of acceptance rates everywhere this season, it will be interesting to compare data for the students who choose to enroll at these schools in fall 2018.  Past middle 50 ACT scores for enrolled students: fall 2017 BC 31-33, BU 29-32 fall 2016 BC 30-33, BU 28-32 Depending on the program of study, these schools are close enough that ranking should not be a factor in the decision.  However, the campuses are so different that it\u2019s hard to imagine a student not having a significant personal preference for one campus over the other.  OP, maybe you need to visit them again, talk with some current students, etc.  ```\n"
