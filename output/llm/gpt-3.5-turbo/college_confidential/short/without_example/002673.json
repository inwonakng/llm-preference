      "content": "College A: ```Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```Olin comment based on recent questions/discussions above:  [QUOTE=\"\"\"\"] TIME/JOBS - My son did have some minor campus employment (interesting stuff, but he did not earn a lot of money).  During senior year he continued his summer gig, a few hours per week remotely (and then went to same place after graduation).  All four years he did A LOT of EC, even though the academic workload/projects were intense.  However he often sacrificed sleep, not uncommon at engineering schools. GPA - There seems less focus than other schools, partly because there is high demand for graduates.   The good thing is that Olin (and MIT and Harvey Mudd and I think some other engineering schools) have pass/fail first semester.  That allows students to get accustomed to college. Also they can learn that collaborative learning is good (and real life!) without worrying about who gets the top grade.   You\u2019d think it would make students lazy, but they work surprisingly hard even in the first semeser. \u201chand-on\u201d - Olin haslots more project work than my engineering program and more than most other programs today.  It is not a vocation-tech kind of thing, w/o mathematical analysis. The technical analysis is often paired with practical uses.   I assume there is less probably less problem set kind of learning than I had. FIT - It is important for a student to be a good match at any school.  But it\u2019s especially critical at teeny school, even more so at Olin since the work is so hard.   It works best if the student absolutely loves the environment and the learning approach.   I often encourage students to put Olin on \u201cthe list\u201d to learn more about project-based learning and hone their education preferences.   But due to it\u2019s low acceptance rate and the fact that it is a niche-fit, I never push hard on it. [/QUOTE]  Another thing I should mention is that small schools have few majors, so  opportunity for switching is very limited.   If you evolve to a major not offered, you need to transfer.  Due to Olin\u2019s non-traditional course sequences, it might be hard to transfer credits.  (Not sure - a very high percentage of students stay.)  ```\n"
