What if he wants to go to grad school right after undergrad (some entrepreneurs chose to pursue a JD, Master in Business Analytics, MFin, MFE, etc.)? Also, applications of entrepreneurship extend beyond the startup world.  I find it interesting that you mentioned startups.  One of the most important players in the startup world are VC/PE (Venture Capital/Private Equity) firms and Investment Banks (who handle M&A, IPOs, underwriting, etc.).  These firms care a lot about GPA for the limited undergrad recruitment they do.  Financing (both buy-side and sell-side) play a huge role in the startup world and the OP\u2019s son may be interesting in pursuing that as someone studying Econ.  Both schools are excellent choices for this career path and have different strengths in this regard.  One of Brown\u2019s strengths is less worrying about GPA.  OP + son should weigh the benefits of each school and decide accordingly.  ```\n"
