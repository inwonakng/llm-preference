That might be worth considering as well, given that there would likely be less grade deflation as compared with GA Tech. The ostensibly higher GPA at UGA (compared with GA Tech) might help with future admission to med school. Also, graduating as a Fellow (top student at UGA) would likely lead to some scholarships from some medical schools as well, assuming OP does not change majors along the way. In any case, there is an argument to be made for many of the great options on the table, although taking on debt is very personal and should be discussed carefully with her/his family.  ```\n"
