I almost can\u2019t believe you even asked, but I mean that in a nice way. There is no questions that she should go to Kenyon. Princeton Review\u2019s list of Best Professors, as rated by colleagues, has Kenyon with 8 professors. Harvard has fewer. She will be well prepared for grad school or a PhD. I am sure she can defer if needed. Congratulations to her!  ```\n"
