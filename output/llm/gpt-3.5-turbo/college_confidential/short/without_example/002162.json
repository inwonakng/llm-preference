I think objectively Stanford has the edge. better athletics, better weather, overall stronger school with more resources available because it has top grad schools (say you wanna do research at the medical school/hospital or the business school, or take a law or business class etc).  Also for practically all majors Stanford is just as good or stronger than Princeton. Most importantly, since you gel much better with the coach and team at Stanford I dont see why you wouldn\u2019t go there. All that said, you cannot go wrong with either choice.  ```\n"
