As for BU SMED, they do require the MCAT, although the required score is not as onerous as some other combined programs, and the GPA requirement of a 3.2 is relatively low.  [quote] Seven-year medical students entering the program after May 2013, although admitted to the School of Medicine, are required to take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) no later than January of the third year in the program. Students must achieve a combined score at or above the 80th percentile on the four numerically scored sections of the MCAT. The results of the MCAT are considered by the Promotions Committee when it makes the final decision as to whether to promote a student to the medical curriculum. [/quote]   ```\n"
