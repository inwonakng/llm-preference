I\"\"m sure there are special cases \u2013 even at D3 \u2013 where it would be very difficult for a student athlete to juggle their sport plus pre-med (or Engineering). And it doesn\u2019t surprise me that Harvey Mudd might be one of those special cases. It\u2019s exceptionally rigorous. But Williams, Amherst, CMC, Pomona, Middlebury \u2013 these are schools where the large pluralities of the students are varsity athletes, and most chose D3 just so that they could find the right balance between sport and school. And, by all accounts, most do that very well.  ```\n"
