In fact, both of my kids attended schools for fit that weren\u2019t the highest ranked schools they got into.  But Ross is a pretty exceptional school for a BBA, with particularly good opportunities who want to study business.  In this case, I think you WOULD find that Ross graduates earn more if that is the criteria you want to use.  Also, I think the OP has honestly been looking for reasons to not stay close to home \u2013 and I think in this case, they are making a mistake.  But obviously they are free to make their own choice, and give that Ross spot up to someone else.  ```\n"
