I mean only having to pay for one year of law school from a top 25 school seems like a no brainer to me. [/quote]  Choose Alabama for the undergrad value, which includes saving money for grad school.  Do not choose it for the law school value.  You can make the law school choice at a much later date, after you have a better idea of your future geography and likely apply to some T14s as well.  (Do not underestimate how much more difficult it is to get a BigLaw interview, let alone a job, at a firm outside the region as an Alabama law student than it would be as a T14 law student.  The difference in ranking between, say, a #10 and #27 is much larger than it may seem and is not analogous to undergrad ranking systems, where such a difference would be slight.)  ```\n"
