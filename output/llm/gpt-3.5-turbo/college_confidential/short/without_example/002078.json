Most students only borrow the student loans, and go to places that they can afford without loans bigger than that.  That is why nationwide most students go to community colleges or commuting distance 4-years. The students who attend the expensive places have:  parents who have saved a lot of money to pay for college, or parents who make a lot of money, or parents who are willing to live on one parent\u2019s income for four years and spend all of the other parent\u2019s income on college costs, or grades/test scores/other talents that will get them significant merit-based aid, or family income that qualifies them for significant need-based aid, or parents/grandparents/siblings/other relatives who are crazy enough to borrow and/or cosign big loans.  My kid went to community college for two years, and then to an in-state U, because that was what fit our budget.  She graduated with only the junior and senior year student loans.  We didn\u2019t take on any debt.  This has not kept her from being successful in her career. Run all the numbers that you have so far here: http://www.finaid.org/calculators/awardletter.phtml Look at what the loan amounts mean here: http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml Then run the numbers again assuming you do your first two years at a CA CC, and finish up at a UC or CSU.  That may be your best option overall.  ```\n"
