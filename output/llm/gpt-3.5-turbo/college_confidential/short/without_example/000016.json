As new fields develop, they split off from the more established departments. Physics gave birth to EE, and EE had to fight for it.  ME is responsible for a lot of the development in BM, but so are ChE, EE and the life sciences. As these field continue to develop, the interdisciplinary nature of BME becomes more complex and apparent. Sometimes the parents don\u2019t like to see the children leave home. They don\u2019t like the loss of control of their offspring and they don\u2019t like the competition for resources within the institution. This result is the fruit of academic politics, but programs do differ. This is another step in the ongoing evolution of engineering/science. Learn about the siblings.  I believe JHU covers the interdisciplinary range of BME.  I am not sure here, but I believe GT is more into the robotics side of BME.  Check with GT.  ```\n"
