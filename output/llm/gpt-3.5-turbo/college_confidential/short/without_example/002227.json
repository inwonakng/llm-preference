The basic level of subjects that are normally taught over 2 semesters will be taught over 3 quarters at schools with a quarter system.  Of course Stanford has different levels of Math just like Princeton, Yale, and probably all major universities. Regarding the various ATH classes Stanford offers, I am just bringing up their existence and the fact that Princeton doesn\u2019t have that and it\u2019s something an Athlete with the OPs choice can take into consideration.  ```\n"
