With respect to major choices that might be appropriate, you might consider computer science, math, physics, economics, or a combination from this group. In terms of post-graduate earnings potential, early career salaries can be found through U.S. News. Hamilton appears highest among the NESCAC LACs in this area. But, as stated, be sure their curriculum appeals to you based on your sincere academic interests.  ```\n"
