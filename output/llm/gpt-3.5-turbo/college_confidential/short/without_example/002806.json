The fact the 75th percentile is nearly the same for both schools is telling. And remember, top colleges that don\u2019t demand scores are still vetting thoroughly. How you perform in hs, related to your possible major or interests, the rigor, the nature of your activities, how you write, etc, show drives, thinking,  potential. Not just SAT or ACT. The reports on hs performance vs \u201ccollege success\u201d often fall back on quantitative - eg, soph college grades. That\u2019s not always an effective comparison, especially not at a \u2018highly competitive,\u2019 where the great mass of students are highly educated through high school, intellectually alert, have ideas about their futures. Odd that one link used some WV college and Houston Baptist as examples.  Not the same league as we\u2019re talking.  ```\n"
