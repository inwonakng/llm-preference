My daughter looked at Carleton and most of the NESCAC schools. She really liked several of the NESCAC schools but fell in love with Carleton and was admitted ED. Had that not worked out, she would have applied to Middlebury, Bowdoin and perhaps a few other schools in the northeast, but she had no intention of applying to Amherst.  ```\n"
