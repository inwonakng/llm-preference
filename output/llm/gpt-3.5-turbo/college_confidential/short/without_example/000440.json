And you\u2019re guessing in post #56 is wildly incorrect. Also, the information that I have offered is verifiable. As for relevance of MBA programs, I agree that it has little impact at UGA, but disagree with respect to IU-Kelley. Again, please understand that others have valuable insights, experiences & knowledge to share about UGA. Getting lost in this discussion is the fact that the OP is not even in the business school at UGA.  ```\n"
