But not necessarily the exact way many would perceive it to be. My answer to your question,  is that In the hands of the right student an Auburn degree can most definitely be as valuable. Ie Tim Cook and countless others.  But the average Princeton student (versus Princeton as an entity) is so darn smart they will succeed at a higher frequency than most other students,  especially in certain academically rigorous professions such as advanced science and research  medicine & academia. Highly selective undergraduate recruiting also benefits the Ivy Leaguer. But after that first job or the professional school admittance - the advantages dissipate. There  is loads of research on the pay gap initially enjoyed by the ivy level grad disappeaing over time. It soon becomes more about the indiovud than the college advantage. I also think the Princeton grad has the advantage when there is a virtual tie for a promotion or  when competing for a position.  But as Marilyn Monroe. stated.   \u201cLooks are great but after two minutes you\u2019re on your own\u201d.  Such is life and such is the ug presitige advantage.  ```\n"
