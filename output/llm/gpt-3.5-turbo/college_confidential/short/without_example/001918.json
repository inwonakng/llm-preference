Or do you mean that you would be paying full tuition and full room board expenses etc? (because if it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s more than $60k per year) And when you say it would be $100k, do you mean over the course of your entire education at Fordham? Just curious as my younger son plays baseball, did Fordham offer any baseball scholarship money?  And at Alabama do you have an offer or would you be trying to get a walk on spot? Good luck! Sounds like both options are good ones, even if they are different.  ```\n"
