But there\u2019s no denying that T14 affords options not available to most grads of other law schools, or at least makes them far more accessible.  I\u2019m not a big proponent of rankings vs. success when it comes to undergrad, but law school is different.  Case in point, and I know it\u2019s just anecdotal, but my brother graduated T14, decent but unspectacular grades, probably top half, with nothing special as far as law review or other credentials.  He stopped taking interviews after the first 9 firms, including several Big\u2019s.  His wife went to a mid tier law school, similar resume.  She got interviews only with smaller regional firms.  The more prestigious firms will only look at the very top students from schools like hers. Now even if you don\u2019t necessarily desire Big Law, starting out there opens all kinds of doors.  Many move on to smaller firms, clerk for judges, and other things enabled by having those connections and that line on the resume.  ```\n"
