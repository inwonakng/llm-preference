      "content": "College A: ```Columbia University```\nCollege B: ```University of Michigan```\nComment: ```I have seen both the universities from very close quarters. The family has strong connection with both CU and Michigan. Children attended thses schools, though not CS, and are doing well. We often have similar discussions at home now that the fourth generation is entering the colleges. I will write what all of you know, but are debating based on personal preferences and bias.  In terms of placement, Michigan is pretty good. CU is equally good,could be better in programs offered in liberal science and arts. The top tech companies, are not so concerned about the Ivy Tag, and will recruit the best irrespective of the brand. Just not Michigan or Berkeley, even UIUC, Georgia Tech, UT Austin are very favourite grounds of the top tech companies. Many of the lead recruiters are not from Ivy League and have firsthand experience of students coming from public or non-ivy private universities. It is true many parents would like to see their children attending Ivy league or top private universities over top public universities. It is based on the value that we attach to a brand that fits into overall public perception. Good students excel any way and the decision of the schools they attend is also based on the cost of attendance and other preferences, be it place, sports, music, culture. My grand nephew preferred Northwestern over Columbia because he felt the Evanston campus will provide him with better college experience that the CU campus. Very personal and I don't think, we can say whether he was right or wrong. Lots of statistics are being dished out. In my opinion, these things are not the core reasons for choosing the place for undergraduate education.    ```\n"
