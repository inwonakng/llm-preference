The most important ingredients in success are the people. MIT does offer on average higher quality faculty (and better access to the faculty) and a stronger student peer group than UMich, but the ultimate ingredient is you. How much do you need the advice and directions of the faculty and the pressure from your peer group to motivate yourself? If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t waste the money. Another factor to consider is whether you\u2019ll be in the top quartile at MIT (presumably you\u2019ll be in that quartile at UMich). If you\u2019re not, you won\u2019t likely have much better opportunities.  ```\n"
