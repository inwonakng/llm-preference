I ultimately chose Penn because i felt the engineering and business offerings were superior and also because Penn was still strong overall and I felt I would have a well-rounded education. And i did. The Penn curriculum is very flexible and you can take courses in all undergraduate and graduate schools at Penn and there is still room to take electives. Also it is strong across the board so I don\u2019t think you would be getting a more well-rounded education at Yale. That said the academic focus at Yale is different.  More theoretical. In terms of grade inflation, Yale a more grade-inflated.  ```\n"
