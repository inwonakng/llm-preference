From a CS major perspective, there is a disparity in terms of knowledge learned given ABET accreditation exists for one and not the other.  OP can also take grad level CS courses in AI, System Design, or other focus areas at JHU which helps tremendously as well. @Drawcodawn If you\u2019re interested in AI, just reach out to Carol Reiley (JHU alum and wife of Andrew Ng - both needless to say are well known in the field of machine learning and AI and have been known to chat with JHU CS majors).  ```\n"
