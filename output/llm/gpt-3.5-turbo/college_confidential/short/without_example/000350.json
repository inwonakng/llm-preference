She had a range from no aid to very good merit. We really, really struggled with the decision, but it came down to Cornell, ranked #11 for engineering, and VT, ranked #14. Cornell was too expensive for us, and the other schools just didn\u2019t measure up. She cried for 24 hours, then she was over it. She is finishing up her freshman year. She made Deans list last semester (no worries about getting her first choice major) She lives in the engineering housing (Lee Hall, Hypatia  for women, Galileo for men) which has probably made a difference- everyone is taking the same classes and so they all have to study at the same times, no pressure to party when you should study. My favorite part? Everyone seems so happy to be there. When we were wandering around campus trying to come to terms with turning down \u201can Ivy\u201d , kids would literally just start talking to us. \u201cWould your daughter like to see my dorm room? I live in Lee Hall\u201d or telling us about their plans for graduate school, how their classes went, what they thought about work-life balance. Literally random girls we met while petting their dogs. Tons of cute dogs. The parents we met at restaurants were nice, and many were alums. They showed us photos of their kids, they asked us to let them know what she decided. Every single person we met was so great. There were NINE rainbows on our drive home. It was just so great. It IS so great. My friend is a CEO of a tech company in the research triangle. She says \u201csome of the best engineers I hire are VT grads\u201d I\u2019m sorry, I am a little biased, but, really, it\u2019s the whole package. Rutgers is basically a commuter campus. I don\u2019t know much about PSU engineering.  ```\n"
