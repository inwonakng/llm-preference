No one really knows much about more than 1 or 2 school\u2019s undergraduate programs. Obviously, elite privates have advantages over public universities, must have to do with resources (student to faculty ratios, etc.). However, if you\u2019re looking to which gives you an advantage to moving from an engineer, to a senior engineer, to an engineer manager to a technical director and up, there really is no advantage between a Duke and a Michigan degree. Engineering is a meritocracy. Senior managers and directors will want to promote the best engineers. Most of these engineering managers/directors came from public universities, so they are not biased against them. What\u2019s important (in your first year) is talent, work ethic, and social skills. After a few years, experience then also becomes important (an engineering manager is expected to develop their team). If you exhibit these qualities, you will be placed on the leadership track. Of course, graduates from elite schools, are more likely to exhibit these qualities, that\u2019s how they got into those schools in the first place! However, it\u2019s not the school that got them selected for a leadership track, it\u2019s their performance on the job. Now, if you want to earn a BS in engineering, but then jump into consulting, law school, etc, that\u2019s a different conversation.  ```\n"
