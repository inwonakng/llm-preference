He argued it was similar to the one Jewish applicants faced when the ivies didn\u2019t want to admit them but they had the best academic credentials. But I agree that colleges should be able to choose their class as they see fit. BTW, how do you define a genius, I thought I knew one, lol, but he got waitlisted at Stanford.  ```\n"
