Chicago\u2019s significant yield increases with no ED dependency is not something that is organic. What you haven\u2019t shown is defacto data (even from an article that shows Hopkins would lose versus Cornell or Dartmouth (similar to a duke article a while back) and not some garbage database like parchment or outdated revealed preferences survey.  I can believe it loses significantly as would penn to HYPSM, but it is unclear if it does so with Cornell or dartmouth)  ```\n"
