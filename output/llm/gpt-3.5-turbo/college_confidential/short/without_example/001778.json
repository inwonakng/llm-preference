Its very likely none of the advice resonates with his situation. We know very little about OP\u2019s intended majors or family finance, we are not even certain if he was already accepted at both schools.  But a few things were clear: OP\u2019s family is in 250K+ range (that\u2019s MIT full pay threshold) and OP would choose MIT if there were no price differential. If OP is offered MIT EA and UM full ride he is such a high achiever that he is likely to have a mid career income 300K+ twenty years from now. For a person having a future earning $250k+/yr for 25+ years a $250k difference does not look so big. As @Much2learn suggested people who think MIT new grad being offered more than $200k total compension is out of the norm are probably out of touch with today\u2019s job market. I know a few MIT kids who have received multi-million dollar funding from VCs while still in college.  There are possibilities that MIT undergrad experience may offer but they hardly exist at UM.  ```\n"
