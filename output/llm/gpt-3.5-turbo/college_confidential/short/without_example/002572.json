When I look back at Amherst, the STEM classes launched my career path\u2026but if I had to list the 10 most memorable classes/professors I encountered while I was there\u20267-8 would be non-STEM.  The open curriculum allowed me to follow my career interests while taking advantage of the greatest resource the school has to offer\u2026its teachers. Last August I spoke with a Physics prof at Amherst.  He was already making preparations to move his lab to the new science building.  Very excited about it.  If your son chooses Amherst, those facilities will come online right when he would need them.  ```\n"
