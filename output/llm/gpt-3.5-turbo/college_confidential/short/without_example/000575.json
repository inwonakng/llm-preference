I had a son at VT. He loved it there. Just anecdotal, but my son had a female Cornell engineering student on his team for an internship. They were both offered full time positions at graduation. VT has a very large Career Fair. There are  detailed post grad surveys available  online and VT engineers are very well recruited by many different companies. Of course, Cornell is an excellent choice as well. Any of these schools will provide an excellent education. She may do best at the school she feels most comfortable at, which may not end up being where others think she should go or want her to go ! Good luck with the decision!  ```\n"
