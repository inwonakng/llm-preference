It\u2019s possible.  I find it surprising, but I\u2019ve seen other posts on these boards where people out east know Northeastern but not NU, or people who confuse the two. Yes, most educated people know NU.  Also, a lot of people\u2013educated or otherwise\u2013know NU because of its affiliation  with the Big Ten.  There are a lot of college football fans.  There are a lot of NFL fans who may not care about the college game but sort of know that NU is a Big Ten school, Stanford is a Pac-12 school, Vandy is an SEC school, Duke is an ACC school (though Duke, of course, is much more known for its prowess in basketball). I\u2019m willing to bet dollars to doughnuts that @robotrainbow is not a football fan.  That\u2019s not a knock.  Just a relatively safe deduction.  ```\n"
