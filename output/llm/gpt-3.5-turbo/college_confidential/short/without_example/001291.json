I know Amherst has tons of funding for these things (and help with the initial dorm stuff, coat, etc too), not sure about Dartmouth. Career center at Amherst is very strong also, lots of programs, speakers, workshops etc. I\u2019m sure you know engineering is out if you choose Amherst. CS or whatever else. Easy double major too, if you like, with no required distribution courses.  ```\n"
