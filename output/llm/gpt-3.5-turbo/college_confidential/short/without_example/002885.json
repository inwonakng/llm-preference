There is a lot of false hearsay on this thread alone.  Case in point @Penn95 Where on earth are you getting the deflation stats?  JHU\u2019s average GPA across the campus is a 3.35.  Is that major grade deflation?  Is Cornell\u2019s \u201cnowhere near that bad\u201d?  Where do you pull this stuff. As for prestige, I would argue JHU over both (I chose Hopkins over Cornell but did not apply to Dartmouth). But that is subjective as well.  ```\n"
