And it\u2019s on the west side of campus, not on top of, but not far from the engineering buildings. My daughter was a double major (in French and Francophone Studies) and she never complained about the distance to her classes. She\u2019s a kind of shy, studious kid and we didn\u2019t think PSU was the right fit and it turned out she knew herself well and thrived there.  ```\n"
