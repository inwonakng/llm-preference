Michigan is ranked #4 Engineering!!  https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/eng-rankings And Finance also #4!!  https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-finance Why should a student ignore this exactly?? IF the question is Engineering between the 2 schools isn\u2019t it clear??  And since you entered Finance I think it is very clear as well.  ```\n"
