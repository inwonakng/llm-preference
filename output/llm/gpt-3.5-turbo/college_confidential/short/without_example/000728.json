Assuming taxes at around 40% then it\u2019s (400-170)/.6 = 383k over two years. That\u2019s actually less than anyone I know made in two year combined after being out of schools for two+ years. So that number could be higher, but sure maybe the MBA is half cost. It\u2019s still much more expensive than the gap between Wharton undergrad and Stern in this case. I fully understand the decision to go with Stern if the financial burden is too high on the family. It just seems silly to say it\u2019s too high but then get an MBA which is even more expensive and generally less impressive than just having gone to Wharton for undergrad.  ```\n"
