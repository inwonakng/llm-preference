My D1 was a GAP admit a few years back, she had acceptances from Harvard, UPenn and other top schools for undergrad. In her case though, she did not receive any scholarships from either Harvard or UPenn, EFC too high as well. She is at Pitt Med now. She graduated from Pitt with close to a perfect GPA and an MCAT score of 36 and did not even bother applying to other Med schools. She has had a fantastic experience at Pitt, both academically and socially. She has done a volunteer gig last summer in an Argentinian community hospital and has lined up a couple more for next summer. Recently, she and her team were given a sizable grant (from a private drug company) to implement a drug distribution model alongside their Pitt Pharmacy folks in rural China. As a proud parent, I am happy to see her blossom into a terrific young lady. I am very sure the environment at Pitt played quite a big role in this.  ```\n"
