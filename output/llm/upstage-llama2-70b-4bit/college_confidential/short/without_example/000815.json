    "user_input": "College A: ```Pomona College```\nCollege B: ```Johns Hopkins University```\nComment: ```2021 is a bad year to compare given the concordance issues with the new SAT and old SAT (also, Pomona\u2019s CDS states 1370-1540, not 1330-1520). If those numbers are accurate for Hopkins (they seem higher than what the admitted profile reports, which is usually not the case, but theoretically it is possible), then they\u2019ve deliberately shifted their admissions process to be more numbers driven. Those numbers would be at or above what schools like Stanford, Harvard, and Yale reported this year.  At least from 2014-2016, JHU was ranked around 20 or so for entering student testing (one source here: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-50-smartest-colleges-in-america-2016-10) so going to top 5 or so is a big shift. Pomona\u2019s numbers have actually come down slightly despite more and more applicants, and I think it\u2019s due to the opposite effect. They\u2019ve cut down on a numbers driven process (at one point, Pomona was ranked 5th in the nation for highest entering student stats) in pursuit of a holistic one, though they still want top students (hence the high % ranked in the top 10%). Pomona has had the highest percent of underrepresented minority students of any highly ranked LAC or university for the past two years, alongside their commitment to socioeconomic diversity (top 10 by a ranking in NYTimes and one of only three private colleges to be there; JHU ranked 72), first-gen students, rural representation, QuestBridge, two cohorts of Posse, and other community-based partnerships. Furthermore, compare what each admissions website has to say: JHU: https://apply.jhu.edu/application-process/ We\u2019re looking for students who can think beyond their limits, who don\u2019t see \u2018impossible\u2019 as a roadblock, and who will not only elevate themselves, but also those around them. Pomona: https://www.pomona.edu/admissions/apply Evidence of: Investment and involvement in a community or passionate pursuit A love for learning, and a willingness to challenge yourself and go outside your \u201ccomfort zone\u201d An openness to new ideas and rejection of easy answers An appreciation for a collaborative learning environment Personal character \u2014 be it grit, kindness, diligence or serving others Risk-taking and adventurousness Creativity and innovation Appreciation for the visual and/or performing arts Is one harder to get into? I feel like a high stats student with good ECs and clear ambition could potentially count on getting into JHU in a way they can\u2019t at Pomona. OTOH, the students scoring the 30 or below at Pomona might not be able to get into JHU. I don\u2019t think this is too important to a decision making process in particular, but I do find it intriguing that the schools look for different things. JHU really seems to stress challenging one self and seeking to be the best you can be. Pomona has more of the liberal arts character. It can be a good reflection of the sort of students who attend either one.  ```\n",
