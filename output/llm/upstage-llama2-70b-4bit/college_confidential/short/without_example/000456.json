Starting pay difference last year was only a difference of less than $12,000. IU-Kelley undergraduate starting pay averaged about $69,300. UGA-Terry undergraduate starting pay averaged about $57,850. Among the 88 undergraduate business schools rated & ranked by P&Q, IU-Kelley had the 11th highest average SAT score, while UGA-Terry had the 45th or 46th highest SAT score average. Internship placement rate at IU-Kelley was 91%, at UGA-Terry it was 85%. A large part of your decision, therefore, should be based on what type of undergraduate college experience you want. IU-Kelley will be business & academic focused. Your new friends will be business students & Hutton Honors College students for the most part. Followed by Business Honors in your second year & thereafter. At UGA you will have the comfort & familiarity of your high school friends & the advantages of being close to home. Business school will come in a year or two. And you will have a substantial sum to put toward graduate school.  ```\n",
