I was a notorious underachiever that attended one of NYC\u2019s specialized high schools that consistently ranks as being one of the top 10 math-and science schools in the country, managed to graduate magna cum laude from Georgetown University and be admitted to Phi Beta Kappa without producing  a body of work that \u2013 at this point in my life \u2013 I would consider to be representative of those levels of achievement. My D (who thankfully takes after her father and works at a much higher rigor ceiling than I ever did) has produced far better work than I had ever done as an undergraduate and perhaps even as a graduate school student. I suspect that she would probably work at that level at any school. To quote the Danish prince \u201c[she] could be bounded in a nutshell and count [herself] a king [queen?] of infinite space.\u201d Me? Not so much\u2026  ```\n",
