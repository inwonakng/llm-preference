Even so, I\u2019d suggest that the limits are there for a reason. Somebody\u2019s analysis leads to the conclusion that &gt; $31K is not advisable.  FWIW, Yale\u2019s average debt at graduation is about $14K (for students who have any loans, that is, not for all students). So, by both those standards, $60K is a lot (especially if you\u2019re serious about med school, and if $60K represents only part of a much bigger cost difference).  ```\n",
