Penn is need based so if NYU\u2019s offer was based on need, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Penn\u2019s offer was similar in terms of family contribution. If you are keen on pursuing business, I would recommend Wharton.  It is what you do with it but I know I got job interviews based on the Wharton degree. For me there are other factors that would lead me to Penn like coordinated dual degree programs you can do with Wharton undergrad (I was accepted into Wharton and then transferred into M&T) and even though it is an in urban setting, it still have a very campus feel to it.  NYU will pretty much be an all urban setting.  ```\n",
