    "user_input": "College A: ```Columbia University```\nCollege B: ```University of Michigan```\nComment: ```\"\"This is fact, not opinion, state colleges are woefully underfunded by states and not allowed to raise in-state tuition, so they increase the student body size. Doesn\u2019t matter what any ranking says, this is a deteriorating situation. Alexandre, do you deny this?\"\" CU123, many state universities are hurting, just as many private universities are hurting. But we are not discussing public universities on this thread. This thread is about Michigan. Michigan is not hurting. Financially, Michigan is doing very well. The University\u2019s endowment has at the fastest pace of any university in the nation between 1990 and today. In 1989, Michigan\u2019s endowment was not even among the top 30 in the nation. Today, it is the 8th largest. In 2009, in the midst of the financial meltdown, Michigan spent $100 million to buy Pfizer\u2019s global research HQ campus, made up of some 25 buildings and over 2 million square feet of lab space. Naturally, all universities save HYPS can use more money, and Michigan is no exception, but Michigan is very well off\u2026as well off as Columbia. To address your question, yes, I deny this. According to its CDS, Michigan\u2019s student body in programs that enroll both undergraduate and graduate students has indeed increased from 33,481 in 2007 to 38,076 in 2016. But the size of its instructional faculty in programs that enroll both undergraduate and graduate students has also increased from 2,063 in 2007 to 2,583 in 2016. The student to faculty ratio has remained steady at 15:1. So yes, I deny it, and I have the facts to prove it. http://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2007-2008_umaa.pdf  (Section I2) http://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2016-2017_umaa.pdf (Section I2) But tell me again, how do you justify Columbia\u2019s shameless claim that it has a 6:1 student to faculty ratio when it omits 6,500 graduate students from its calculation? Oh, that\u2019s right, Columbia does not publish a CDS report. In fact, it is the only Ivy League institution that doesn\u2019t. But one thing is clear, Columbia is omitting 6,500 graduate students from its student to faculty ratio and that puts into serious question its ethical practices, as well a the integrity of the data it publishes. Columbia\u2019s actual student to faculty ratio would likely double if it were being honest, and its ratio would be 12:1 rather than 6:1. But that would mean a drop in the rankings, so obviously, Columbia and its private peers have little incentive to be honest. And what of the very flawed rankings methodology? Do you deny that private universities are gaming the rankings and that the methodology is seriously flawed?  ```\n",
