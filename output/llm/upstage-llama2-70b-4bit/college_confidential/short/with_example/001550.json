    "user_input": "College A: ```Yale University```\nCollege B: ```University of Wisconsin-Madison```\nComment: ```I realize there are more important things than money, but for the sake of argument\u2026 A physician graduating from Harvard undergrad will make exactly as much money as a graduate from a small extension campus of a state university. Undergrad has nothing to do with compensation. In the situation above, where the recent graduate got the $70K per year job: I assume her alternate path would be a lesser paying job, say $40,000 just for discussion. Say both jobs are in California. the 70K job will take home about 52K after federal, state, social sec, medicare, etc. The 40K job will take home will take home about 33K for a difference of 19K per year. Keeping the arithmetic simple 240K divided by 20K is a 12 year payback. But the arithmetic is not that simple. If the 240K were invested it would likely double resulting in a payback of 24 years. And that assumes that a 22 year old would start saving 100% of the difference between the two jobs, the likelihood of which is about zero. So the real time to pay back easily exceeds a quarter century for most people. I am not arguing that making more money is pointless. However, giving up savings and compounding investment returns in exchange for a system of progressive taxation a questionable choice. The same is true on the other end of the workalike calendar. If you are nearing retirement, would you rather have saved more than enough or hope that your final years are the highest paying and maybe you can save the difference realizing that is precisely when companies will wonder about younger, less expensive replacements? I would pick savings. A hard to calculate factor is that compensation arc. For the physician, the slope of the arc is zero. It just doesn\u2019t matter where a person did undergrad. For many other jobs, the Ivy league graduate might have an accelerated compensation arc over a career, mitigating the time for payback of the more expensive education.  ```\n",
