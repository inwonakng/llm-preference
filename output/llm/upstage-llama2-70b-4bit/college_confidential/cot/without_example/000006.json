However, the harsh reality in today\u2019s job market (ok, in any generation\u2019s job market), prestige matters. JHU and CalTech are ranked up there with the Ivies and certain corporations will only hire from what they consider \u201celite\u201d universities. In addition, let\u2019s say your son doesn\u2019t want to do BME after exploring that field. Google, Goldman, McKinsey would be happy to talk to him if he goes to JHU or CalTech. It would be possible from G-Tech, but harder for sure. Call these firms snobs if you want, but it\u2019s their money.\n\nStep 1: Read the comment carefully.\nStep 2: Identify the mention of Options A and B.\nStep 3: Analyze the context and tone of the comment regarding the mentioned options.\nStep 4: Determine if there is an explicit or implicit preference towards either option.\nStep 5: Make a conclusion about the preference based on the analysis.\n\nThe comment mentions both Option A (California Institute of Technology) and Option B (Johns Hopkins University). These institutions are regarded as highly prestigious and are mentioned along with the Ivy League Universities. The comment also states that attending either university could improve the chance of being recruited by top companies like Google, Goldman Sachs, and McKinsey & Company. While the comment does not expressly state a preference between the two options, it implies that both are similarly desired because of their prestige.\n\nConclusion: Neither Option A nor Option B has been explicitly stated as more preferable than the other. Therefore, the final decision is: Equal Preference\n\n%%% Equal Preference",
