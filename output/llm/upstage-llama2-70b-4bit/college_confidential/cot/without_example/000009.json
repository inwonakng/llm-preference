Here we go...\n\nOption A: Prestige Matters\nOption B: Other Factors Matter Too\n\nComment: [quote] @KeepItFair said: However, the harsh reality in today\u2019s job market (ok, in any generation\u2019s job market), prestige matters.[/quote] If you have a citation for this as it relates to engineering, please provide it. The reality is, companies MAY have pet schools, and they frequently, for engineering at least, are not the usual suspects. Grades and internships/coops also matter. A marginal student from Option A will not have the same opportunities as a student with a high GPA and good work or research experience from Option B. The name will not guarantee success.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the quote provided.\n\nQuote: \"@KeepItFair said: However, the harsh reality in today\u2019s job market (ok, in any generation\u2019s job market), prestige matters.\" This statement suggests that having a degree from a prestigious institution has its benefits in terms of employment opportunities.\n\nStep 2: Consider the context of the discussion.\n\nThe conversation focuses on comparing two aspects - Option A and Option B. Both seem to carry significant value when evaluating future prospects.\n\nStep 3: Assess the significance of additional factors mentioned in the quote.\n\nThe quote goes on to say, \"Grades and internships/coops also matter,\" implying that elements apart from the institution's reputation play a role in shaping future prospects.\n\nStep 4: Summarize the main idea expressed in the quote.\n\nOverall, the quote highlights that while the prominence of an institute impacts career possibilities, it isn't the sole deciding factor. Aspects such as academic performance and hands-on experience also influence an individual's chances of achieving success.\n\nFinal Decision: Equal Preference\n\nAfter taking everything stated in the quote into consideration, it appears that neither Option A nor Option B holds a clear advantage over the other. Instead, the relative merits of each aspect might vary based on personal preferences and needs. Thus,\n\n%%% Equal preference",
