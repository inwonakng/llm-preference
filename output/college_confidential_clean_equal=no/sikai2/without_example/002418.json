I do, however, agree with @doschicos that Bates is arguably the most laid back of the three you are considering. On a side note- when my daughter visited Williams she spent the day on campus. Attended class, danced in the studio, tried to take in as much as possible. She did feel the environment was intense at Williams, that it had a similar feel to Swarthmore, and for that reason Williams did fall off of her list. At Middlebury the students seemed like they were having fun; at Williams not so much that particular day. Having said that, she has two friends at Williams and they absolutely love Williams! Bottom line is that all three are great school and the comparisons are truly relative and certainly subjective   ```\n",
