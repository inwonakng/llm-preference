Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```@helpless2017 I will ask my Oliner your question, but I have a feeling others here can answer it easily. I see @NoVADad99 already took a swing at it. FWIW, the project my son is working on is run by a student, so I assume the author of the work will be the student. Changing topics slightly, when you\u2019re looking at statistics about graduate schools and Olin try to factor in that many Olin students do some time in the workforce and then head for graduate school. They have an office of \u201cPost Graduate Planning,\u201d that assists students with post Olin planning and strategy (http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/careers-graduate-studies/). Finally, definitely check out the way Olin has produced Fulbright scholars. It may be interesting to compare Olin and GT by Fulbright recipients (while taking Olin\u2019s smaller size into consideration). I haven\u2019t seen the comparison.  ```\n",
