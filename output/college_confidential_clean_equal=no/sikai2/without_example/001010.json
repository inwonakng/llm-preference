And yes, it\u2019s an overgeneralization, but I think you\u2019d find that a significantly smaller portion of the USC student body go there mainly or solely for the pursuit of knowledge. It\u2019s definitely a pre-professionally focused student body, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, nor do I think that\u2019s bad for the OP, who seems pretty pre-professionally focused, but my impression is that a smaller proportion of the kids at USC go there to live the life of the mind compared to at the U of C or HYPSM.  ```\n",
