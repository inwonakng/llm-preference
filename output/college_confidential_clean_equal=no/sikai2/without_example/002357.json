But it does boil down to how much you\u2019re willing and able to spend for a luxury item.\u201d Hunt nails it.  The kid expresses a clear preference for the Columbia \u201cexperience\u201d over the nearby State U \u201cexperience\u201d (even though the State U here is one of the best state Us there is).  6,000 undergrads in NYC and 29,000 undergrads in Ann Arbor are very different propositions obviously.  Seems like this kid likes strawberry more than chocolate, which is fine. Unless there\u2019s a clear need to preserve cash for grad school (doesn\u2019t seem to be), the family can afford to pay full price.  So this very lucky kid should go to where this kid wants to go.  Which is probably Columbia.  ```\n",
