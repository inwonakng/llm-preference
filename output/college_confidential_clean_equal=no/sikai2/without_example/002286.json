    "user_input": "College A: ```Columbia University```\nCollege B: ```University of Michigan```\nComment: ```\u201cI believe the Michigan places 1/3 at those 4 firms. There is nowhere you can\u2019t reach from Michigan. I just think that Columbia students are probably placed at higher rates in top positions, and also may be likely to be recruited for other options.\u201d I don\u2019t see why that would be the case since Michigan and Columbia are considered peer institutions by the firms recruiting their graduates. \u201cAdditionally, it is likely that Columbia students are more likely to have internships and job opportunities at companies right in NYC, where Google owns an entire building, Bloomberg hires many, IBM, Palantir, Jane Street etc.\u201d I don\u2019t think finding great internships is a challenge for Michigan students. When you have thousands of gifted undergraduate students, companies come to you. \u201cThe person said that there were 6 candidates being interviewed that day, and they were from MIT, Penn, Princeton, Berkeley, and Duke. That has a strong appearance of being a position where the name of the school matters. I do think a Michigan grad can get into that group, but I suspect it would be easier for a Columbia grad. They are both strong brands, but the Columbia brand is very strong in NYC.\u201d This is so random it is not even worth discussing. But yes, in NYC, Columbia\u2019s brand exceeds that of Michigan. Then again, it exceeds that of virtually every university in the world save perhaps Harvard, and even that is debatable. But the OP has not indicated that his goal is to live in NYC. In other parts of the country, Columbia\u2019s corporate reputation does not exceed that of Michigan. When it comes to graduate school or professional placement, Columbia offers no advantage over Michigan. Like I said earlier, when choosing between Michigan and Columbia, one need not concern himself with the quality of those universities since they are roughly equal. If cost is a concern, and one is cheaper than the other, then the cheaper option is the way to go. If cost is not a concern, going for fit is the way to go.  ```\n",
