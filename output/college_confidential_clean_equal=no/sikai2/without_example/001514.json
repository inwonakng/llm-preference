    "user_input": "College A: ```Harvard University```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```I agree with @privatebanker on his first point but disagree on the second.  @manyloyalties posits a powerful argument, but it\u2019s built on a lot of assumptions.  A lot of assumptions. GA Tech knows that you\u2019re an elite admit.  This is why they are offering a full ride, plus a stipend (they are paying you to attend!), plus money for research and internet travel, plus several other perks.  What is Harvard\u2019s pitch? Nothing, aside from admission.  Harvard will not sweeten the deal (there is no deal; you\u2019ve been admitted; that\u2019s it).  Harvard will not work to compete with other offers.  Harvard doesn\u2019t have to.  It\u2019s Harvard. But what does that mean?  Listen, I am not anti-Ivy.  I admire the students who have worked so hard to gain admission to the Ivies, Stanford, Duke and so on.  But I also admire those who take a pass, knowing that there\u2019s a better offer on the table.  You\u2019ll also be known on the GA Tech campus, and for the rest of your life actually, as the guy who got into Harvard but told them to take a hike.  There\u2019s something admirable about that. You\u2019re in a position that is common.  You got into your dream school, but your family cannot afford it.  I don\u2019t know if this is because your family\u2019s EFC at Harvard is too high or because your parents are not willing to pay it.  Either way, Harvard is unaffordable.  GA Tech is not.  Full rides should not be treated lightly, and I know that you are not doing so.  In fact, I got a strong sense that you know that GA Tech is the smart move.  It\u2019s the brand name and prestige of Harvard that is beckoning. Google the story of the young man who was admitted to all eight Ivies, plus Stanford, Duke, and so on.  He turned them all down to accept an offer just like yours to attend the U. of Alabama.  Why?  The same situation as you.  He wants to become a doctor and felt, with the cost of medical school ahead, he would be best served (and save his family money) to take the full ride. I wish you best with whatever choice you make.  ```\n",
