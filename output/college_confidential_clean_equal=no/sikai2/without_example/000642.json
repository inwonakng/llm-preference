Even if he walks in with 25, 30, even 40% of the total credit volume, he\u2019ll have to take certain classes in strict sequence, and some of them will only be offered during specific terms that might not align with his progress. My son started with quite a few meaningful hours in mechanical engineering. He tested into Calc III, Physics II, and completely out of Chem and several GEs. He printed his curriculum sheet and traced through all of the prerequisites from senior project, backwards through his entire curriculum, to plot the most efficient path. There was no way to cut it below 4 years. He took a couple of light quarters (12 hours) and still only had 15 of 45 quarter hours left his senior year. The problem was, half of them were senior project. He decided to use his time taking graduate classes and will walk with a BS/MS in about 4.5 years. What ends up happening in an engineering curriculum is that a lot of the GE hours go unused.  ```\n",
