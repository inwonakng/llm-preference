But it\u2019s OPs decision ultimately. Somebody did mention the transportation factor.  St. Louis is closer to Hong Kong than Boston and Lambert International doesn\u2019t have as many flight cancellations as Logan International.  If a winter snowstorm hits the Northeast, then the traffic situation is a mess. St. Louis gets snow, but it\u2019s more manageable. One more question, what are your future career plans and how does name recognition fit in the future?   I bet very few people in Hong Kong/Asia in general have heard of Bowdoin.  Unless  you\u2019re going to law/graduate school, a Political Acience/Philosophy major isn\u2019t going to open too many doors in Asia.  Not that there is anything inherently wrong with that. I admire someone who\u2019s breaking the Asian STEM stereotype, but unless OP is related to Li Kashing or the Ho family, there isn\u2019t much of a future unless the correct school is selected.  And Asian culture is still unfortunately close minded at times when it comes to education/careers.  ```\n",
