The OP has provided so little information, that is not even possible to make suggestions in terms of what schools could be a financial, social,  and academic fit. Other son does some recruiting for one of the tech firms mentioned here a few times (he is there to talk about the technical side of things and working for the company). Most of his time is spent on technical projects, the campus visits are just an extra thing he\u2019s been asked to become involved with.  He just went to Michigan last month. He has also been to Yale, Penn, and Georgia Tech in the last year. Michigan is certainly not going to hold the OP back in any way.  ```\n",
