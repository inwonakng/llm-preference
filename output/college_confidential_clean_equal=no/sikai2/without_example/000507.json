    "user_input": "College A: ```Vassar College```\nCollege B: ```Kenyon College```\nComment: ```Binge drinking is a problem at many schools, large and small and there have been tragedies at many schools. I can\u2019t recall the source, but I\u2019ve read that greek life, high varsity athletic participation, and rural location each contribute to campus drinking culture. Many students choose not to partake at lots of schools but, like the \u201chow to avoid lax bro culture\u201d in another thread, for students who are looking to avoid a dominant scene, it is helpful to really talk to a lot of students and possibly spend time on campus on a Wed (usually a big party night) or weekend night and see for themselves. Even then, it is hard to put in perspective \u2013 my non-drinking high school senior was shocked by the party scene at some schools, but now partakes, usually in moderation, I think. So what a 17-18 year old thinks may change. I was one of the parents who described our experience with Vassar and Kenyon. Kenyon is a wonderful school, wonderful faculty, engaged students. It was the first school each of my kids visited and their first choice early in the process. Eventually, it came off the list, with size and location being part of that decision.  But what was right for them is not a predictor for anyone else. My perception of the student body from visits plus knowing several recent grads and current students, is that there is a sophistication about many of the students that feels \u201curban/east coast.\u201d I would contrast that with, say, Grinnell, which is also a wonderful school with wonderful faculty and engaged students, but feels more \u201cmidwest nice\u201d than \u201ceast coast cool.\u201d Of course, there are students who don\u2019t fit that description at either school. Your mileage may vary. For folks who know, I have been genuinely curious about how the Kenyon greek life housing clusters feels to non-greek life students and whether the chapter houses can be used for parties or not.  ```\n",
