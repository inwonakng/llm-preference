[QUOTE=\"\"\"\"] [quote] [quote] @Zinhead  [/quote] [/quote] [/QUOTE]  Take reported numbers with a grain of salt.  These numbers are often manipulated.  Vandy is uniquely VERY forthcoming about their details, even putting them on their website.  Other schools are purposely more vague (more loosey goosey. Also, we don\u2019t know if other schools more actively limit who can/should apply to med school. BTW\u2026JHU admits to having acceptance rate issues, but rightly explains them by saying that they don\u2019t limit who applies and some students/parents ignore their wise advise and either apply to too many reaches or apply when their stats aren\u2019t med school worthy.  ```\n",
