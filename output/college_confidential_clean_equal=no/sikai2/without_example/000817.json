There are other factors at play in terms of getting into grad school.  But I can tell you that the number one grad school destination for JHU (outside of JHU) for last year\u2019s graduating class was Harvard.  I went to MIT from Hopkins on a full fellowship (amongst the top 10% of entering grad students as did some of my other classmates).  Many of my other classmates across the engineering school also won extremely competitive national fellowships (NDSEG, NSFGRFP, Hertz) or individual full school sponsored fellowships at Princeton (Gordon Wu Fellow), Stanford (SGF program) and Harvard.  You will have no shortage of opportunities at JHU.  I graduated from JHU in 2015, so my experience is also recent. See below for grad outcomes. https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/careers/news/2017-fds/ It also helps that the reputation of JHU in silicon valley is absolutely sterling - it is where you want to be if you want to be in tech.  What is not debatable is the fact that more employers will have heard of and recognize JHU here versus Pomona given JHU\u2019s CS program is actually known. @nostalgicwisdom JHU has had high stats for a while now.  It\u2019s just been slowly going up over the years from the above 1360-1530.  Business Insider is likely using outdated data. See here:  https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2017/01/2014_2015_EnrollmentReport.pdf Class of 2021 enrolled stats: https://hub.jhu.edu/2017/08/25/class-of-2021-overview-facts/ JHU\u2019s combined range is 1480 - 1560. Pomona also self reports the range of SAT scores for the class of 2021 which more or less matches the range above: https://www.pomona.edu/sites/default/files/pomona-college-admissions-profile.pdf Verbal - 670 to 750 Math - 660 - 760 There\u2019s a definite discrepancy.  You can argue one school is more stats obsessed versus the other, but it could also be JHU is finding students that are more well rounded vs Pomona but with higher scores due to the STEM bent.  ```\n",
