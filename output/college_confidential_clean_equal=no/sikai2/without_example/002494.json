PA is more moderate, so the average of 58 means typically highs of 65 lows of 50.  Chicago has an average temp of 50 but more variation. like highs of 80 in the summer and 20\u2019s in the winter.   There are only a few days in Palo Alto where you\u2019d need a light jacket for the cold.  Typically you only need one when it rains.  ```\n",
