Bu has many more applications and bit the pool isn\u2019t necessarily  as deep or talented pool once you get out beyond the a certain number of applications People make a big mistake looking at admit rates as a sign of selectivity.  It\u2019s a sign of application volume. If all students were equal then it would be true. But a school received 60k applications and 4000 were great the rest not competitive   School b has 10k apps because they are Jesuit and expensive. But they 4K admitted non athletes have higher stats tha school a.  You would have one school with a less than 10 percent acceptance rate and school b with a 40 percent acceptance rate. Your chances of getting in were not determined by acceptance rate. It\u2019s the quality of the pool you are swimming in.  ```\n",
