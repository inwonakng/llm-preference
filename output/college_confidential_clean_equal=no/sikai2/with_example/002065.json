She had some good choices, like your daughter, and I didn\u2019t think SMU was going to make the top 3.  After final visits to the other choices - and none of them feeling quite right - she made a trip to SMU by herself for an admitted student weekend.  Within the first few hours, she knew she had found her place.  She works hard at her studies (she is an engineering major) but has had the time and opportunity to be involved with a few campus organizations.  Because she has been involved and met lots of different people, she has had a very good experience so far.  Sounds like your daughter has some great options.  Obviously there were more highly ranked options for engineering schools but we weren\u2019t entirely sure she would enjoy engineering and hoped she would choose a school with lots of other options if she decided to change majors.  Rankings are important, I guess, but we didn\u2019t really care all that much.  Factors like travel distance (she\u2019s 1000 miles away but a short, relatively inexpensive direct flight), job / internship opportunities in large city (Dallas), active campus ministry (we are Catholic), affordability with merit scholarships, and a small, supportive engineering program played into her decision more than any ranking.  ```\n",
