I think you are having trouble deciding because none of these three ticks all of your boxes.  I will add it\u2019s not necessary to tick all of the boxes, nor does a college have to be \u201cperfect\u201d for you to have a good experience and meet your goals. Are you interested in biomedical engineering primarily for the career prospects or would a science major available at a LAC suit you just as well? If you are set on engineering, I would pick GA Tech as few people enrolled at LACs actually do 3+2 programs @Chembiodad 's twin daughters are pursuing STEM disciplines at Hamilton.  Maybe he will weigh in here and/or you can check out the Hamilton forum on CC for more information. Wesleyan skews very left politically - if you want to avoid political extremes, you might want to investigate that angle a bit further. It looks like the cost gap has narrowed among your options.  Do you know what your costs are likely to be with your parents\u2019 new salaries?  Did you run the NPCs with the new amount? These are three excellent but different choices.  Good luck with your decision!  ```\n",
