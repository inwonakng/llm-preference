OP \u2013 recognize that the average college student changes majors three times while in school.  So there\u2019s a good chance that all the fighting over  Columbia\u2019s CS program vs UM\u2019s CS program will be irrelevant to you.  Since you may wind up studying something completely different. If price is an object, most everyone would pick UM in-state over Columbia.  If price is no object, most people would pick Columbia over UM. According to you, price is no object.  So pick the school you like better \u2013 UM and CU are going to be VERY different animals in terms of your college experience.  Pick UM if you want a BIG school, close to home, great college town and rah rah football atmosphere.  Pick CU if you want smaller, away from home, and urban. And ignore all the Bravo Sierra back and forth above.  ```\n",
