This seems to come up every time Brown is mentioned \u2013 but I don\u2019t think the people who spread that misinformation have much recent experience with Brown themselves. [/quote]  There\u2019s no need for anyone to speculate either way, as Brown publishes its grade distributions. The 2016-17 data is below.
