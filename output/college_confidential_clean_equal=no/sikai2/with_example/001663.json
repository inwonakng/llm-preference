There is plenty of info out there about people who do MBAs, paid for at huge expense by their firms, who end up leaving in frustration b/c they are not promoted and/or their new skills are not utilized by their company. It is why more than a few large companies now have internal, company-specific talent development programs- so that they don\u2019t pay for a qualification that can easily walk out the door. Similarly, people returning from international assignments often find it hard to fit back in, and use their new skillsets and perspectives, leading to a lot of attrition there as well- not to mention the ones who are (gently or not) encouraged out the door b/c there is no longer a good place for them. Further, once you are \u201cestablished in mid/upper-management\u201d, the name of your undergrad institution is simply not a big deal- and it is certainly not \u201ccritical\u201d.  What will matter much, much more is your experience and (if you have one) your grad degree. My bona fides for these opinions: BA/MBA/PhD; taught both business & engineering at the university level; experience working for Fortune 500 companies; consultant at one of the big 4 consulting firms.  ```\n",
