But by the end of the day its where you wanted to be and that makes it the right choice. I was one of the earliest posters and keep in mind all the good things I said \u201cThe University of South Carolina Darla Moore International School of Business is rated number one by all accounts. It is NOT an easy school to get into. Having said that, my best friend son graduated from this school last year. He did an internship at Google in Ann Arbor (yes Google is in Ann Arbor) and was offered employment once he graduated. He was super driven and he did a few abroad studies in Spain, Denmark, and I believe even in Brazil. The school IB department is fabulous and competitive. Having said that, his only REGRET was that he did not go to a higher ranked or overall better named school . The overall Business School is good but not like the IB department and not as selective. At the time he was applying to colleges,USC was the most affordable option and that is where he ended up going. He knows that the fact that he graduated for USC did NOT affect internship or job opportunities. He has done quite well for a 23 year old.\u201d  ```\n",
