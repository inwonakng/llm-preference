Of course the Ronald Tutor Center at lunch seems like Times Square in NYC, but once you get off the main paths, you would be surprised by all the lovely fountains and garden areas. I have been there close to 50 times and keep finding new corners of that campus. And the facilities themselves all have wonderful hideaways. The new Marshall//Business building Fertitta Hall is fantastic. The new Village is crazy impressive, so if you get into USC, don\u2019t worry about finding your space there. You have wonderful choices ahead of you. My D didn\u2019t choose UNC CH because with 80% NC students, she feared it would lack the diversity she is use to being in California. Just one perspective of many you can consider.  ```\n",
