I\u2019ve heard that it relates, at least in part, to historical factors \u2013 specifically Bates\u2019 attitude towards coeducation. Bates has been coed since the mid-1800s, while most other NESCACs were all-male until around 1970. So Bates had a good 100-year head start on coeducation. Unfortunately, women didn\u2019t generally have great career opportunities or earning power during the late 1800s and early 1900s. So for most of its history, Bates was at a significant disadvantage relative to the all-male NESCACs in terms of alumni fundraising.  ```\n",
