You could start in a BioE program to see how it goes. If you liked the engineering part more, you could stay in BioE, or you could switch to a more traditional engineering discipline. If you liked the biomedical part more, you could switch to a traditional pre-medical program. You would find both biomedical engineering and DIII swimming at at smaller universities like Tufts, Rochester, Case Western, RPI, or WPI. Bucknell would be a LAC option, but they have DI swimming. Tufts competes in NESCAC, the same DIII league as Amherst.  ```\n",
