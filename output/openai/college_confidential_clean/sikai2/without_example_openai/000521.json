I never visited Kenyon, though it sounds great. I know both older and recent Vassar alumni very well (husband and friends, plus a young relative who is a recent grad), and I have spent time on campus recently. You asked about the social feel. Vassar has a really nice social environment. People are friendly and intellectually oriented, and people tend to form lasting friendships, especially with people in their dorm. Its legacy as a former women\u2019s college may contribute to the fact that not only does it not have any actual frats, but overall it has an inclusive feel to it and not much of a good-old-boy contingent. It is the polar opposite of a frat-dominated college. Theatre is big and wonderful at Vassar. So is social justice. But you also can find kids who love sports and all types of other interests. Vassar also is often identified as having some of the best financial aid in the nation and as making big efforts to increase socioeconomic diversity.  ```\n"
