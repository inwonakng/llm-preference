However, I suspect that the average and below average Michigan students may not be so competitive and that may bring their average down.\u201d Much2learn, the range of Michigan students enrolled in the CoE is similar to the students enrolled at Cornell or Penn. There is no difference in the quality of the students. There may have been a slight difference in quality in the 90s and 00s, but the gap has closed entirely in recent years. There are simple reasons for the small gap in starting pay. First of all, Cornell\u2019s data is for 2017, while Penn and Michigan\u2019s reports are for 2016 graduates. That alone accounts for a 3%-4% difference in pay. Second, the makeup of the students in the engineering programs. For example, at Michigan, most engineering students (over 70%) major in Aerospace, Civil, Chemical, Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical etc\u2026Those aren\u2019t the highest paid Engineering disciplines. At Penn, roughly 50% major in CS, CE-related majors, which pay significantly more. In this regard, Cornell, Michigan and Northwestern have a more balanced concentration of majors than Penn, which seems to lean heavily on CS/CE majors. But even then, the advantage when it comes to placing graduates in companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft clearly favors Michigan, even over the likes of Cornell: Michigan: 149 Penn: 39 Cornell: 38 Michigan is obviously twice larger than Cornell and three times larger than Penn (although Penn has roughly almost as many CS/CE majors as Michigan), but advantage in the number placed in those tippy top Tech firms clearly favors Michigan. Third, while many CS majors end up in Silicon Valley, the majority, certainly over 50%, will work regionally. For example, according to Penn\u2019s report, close to 60% of Penn graduates took jobs in the Mid Atlantic (DC to NYC) and Northeast (mostly Boston). In the case of Michigan (and Northwestern), approximately 50% work in the Midwest. The cost of living in the Midwest is significantly  lower than the cost of living in cities like DC, NYC and Boston, and the starting salaries will usually reflect the cost of living. Since 50%-60% of the graduates work and live regionally, it stands to reason that those take jobs in the most expensive region will have higher starting salaries.  That can easily account for the 15% gap between Michigan (and other Midwestern schools like Northwestern and UIUC) and East Coast universities (like Cornell and Penn). Below are the average starting salaries Engineering/CS graduates: Cornell: $79,000 Michigan: $76,000 Northwestern: $70,000 Penn: $88,000 https://issuu.com/nucareeradvance/docs/beyond_northwestern_handout_2016_fi http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/resources/career_services/students/statistics/upload/Undergraduate-Class-of-2016.pdf  ```\n"
