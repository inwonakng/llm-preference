Last year the maximum state grant per semester for state related schools was $1,886 a semester I believe. But that doesn\u2019t help much. You will have about $23,000 of aid. But it costs at least $32,000 at Pitt. Behrend tuition and fees should be closer to $15,000. If you could commute there for the first two years (possibly less with AP credits), then you might be able to save up money for transferring to he main campus for the last two years. Branch campuses might have some need based scholarships available. You would get a Pell Grant, a smaller state grant (maybe around $3,000), and maybe merit. You should be able to work on weekends.  ```\n"
