It was a week before exams and no one seemed particularly stressed and there were lots of smiles and laughter.     Baltimore is a pretty cool city that gets a bad rap but there is lots to do, great museums that actual abut campus, and free transportation to Inner Harbor.  It\u2019s also an easy trip to DC.  ```\n"
