[/quote]  Other people are implying that. With your comment (especially with the follow-up), @merc81, I didn\u2019t get the sense that you necessarily felt that way. But for example, I interpreted Happytimes2001\u2019s comment to mean that a full-ride to a place like Michigan isn\u2019t so special because \u201canyone at HYPSM could\u2019ve gotten it and turned it down.\u201d Their sentence directly after that seems to imply, to me at least, that the OP should disregard the award for that reason - because MIT is so far and away better than Michigan that the money ceases to matter. However, I think all that is irrelevant anyway. Let\u2019s assume for a second that every single student at MIT could\u2019ve gotten a full ride to Michigan or an equivalent school and turned it down. So what? What bearing does that have on the OP\u2019s choice? The OP\u2019s choice, IMO, hinges on 1) whether Michigan will provide them with a high-quality education and get them to their career and educational goals - and whether they\u2019ll have the kind of college experience there they are looking for - and 2) whether MIT\u2019s offerings in those areas are worth an extra $250K + interest that they could spend on any number of other things (including, potentially, an MBA or other grad degree from MIT or an equivalent school). Other undergrads\u2019 decisions about where they wanted to go to college don\u2019t really matter in this case, is my opinion.  ```\n"
