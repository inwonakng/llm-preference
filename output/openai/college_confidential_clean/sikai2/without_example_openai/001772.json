[/quote]  Those would be the extreme outliers. MIT 2016 course 6-3 graduates had a median pay of $110,000 out of a range of $66,500 to $175,000, according to https://gecd.mit.edu/sites/default/files/about/files/2016-gss-survey.pdf . Recent CS graduates from other similar-reputation-for-CS schools seem similar in this respect: CMU 2016 SCS: https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/2016_one_pagers/scs/scs-ba.pdf UCB 2017 EECS: https://career.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/Survey/2017EECS.pdf UCB 2017 L&S CS: https://career.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/Survey/2017CompSci.pdf  ```\n"
