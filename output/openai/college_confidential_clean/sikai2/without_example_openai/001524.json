MIT/Caltech/GTech or any Engineering schools make things difficult if you are Premed. Faced similar situation. We constantly wonder what if. I understand that 80K is big amount for most people but in the long run it may not be.  I am not even taking account the prestige factor of Harvard. It will be difficult to go against your Dad\u2019s opinion. If you are any of those ORMs, (Chinese, Indian or Jewish), you will thank yourself for not  going to a grade deflated tech school if you are really into premed.  ```\n"
