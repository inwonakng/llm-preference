Looking at the Math sequence clearly shows that.  The Single Variable Calc sequence is 3 courses as well as the MV/LA sequence whereas at Semester schools they are 2 Semester courses.  The Quarter system does give you the opportunity to take more classes you just don\u2019t go into as much depth in any single course as you would with a Semester class.  Also if you\u2019re taking a requirement you don\u2019t like at least it\u2019s only for 10 weeks. I\u2019m not arguing that Princeton is overall more rigorous than Stanford just that Stanford has a lower floor and that for the student seeking that they can find it easier at Stanford than at Princeton.  ```\n"
