Kenyon College\u2019s issues with respect to drinking have been well publicized for years after the death & near death of some students . At least one found dead in nearby corn field. Kenyon administrators also acknowledge that it is an ongoing issue of a serious nature. Kenyon\u2019s campus is beautiful, but small. And, yes, heavy drinking is not uncommon at small, rural, isolated colleges.  ```\n"
