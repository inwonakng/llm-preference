It is several campuses spread all over New Brunswick and Piscataway, and there are so many students who live nearby that the campus empties out every weekend. They go home. I live 45 minutes away, and even the kids who do live on campus freshman year usually move back home sophomore year because there just isn\u2019t a lot going on. You can only tell so much by reading about it. Sometimes you have to experience it. I took classes post grad for a couple of years. Excellent instructors, well-respected program. But it could be lonely for an OOS student, and, well\u2026go HOKIES!  ```\n"
