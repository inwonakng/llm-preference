I think that most of those who are in the clear minority that chooses Penn over Yale do it because they prefer an undergraduate business degree at Wharton, or a dual-degree program. Not a clear argument to do it for bioengineering, or CS either. Like I\u2019ve said on other threads, you have an obvious agenda in your almost 1,500 posts, which is as I summarized above. There\u2019s nothing special about this thread; it\u2019s just the one where I chose to comment on it.  ```\n"
