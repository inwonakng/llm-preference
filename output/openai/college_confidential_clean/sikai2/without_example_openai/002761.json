Yes, there is Greek life at Hamilton, but it is not the raucous in your face frats you may find at other schools.  And the participation rate is not all that high. It\u2019s like splitting hairs to find measurable differences, but Hamilton does have a more open curriculum and may have a slightly more intellectual vibe. Bates more sporty, but not jocky, if that makes sense. Hamilton may have a more diverse student body, Bates may be more community service oriented.  ```\n"
