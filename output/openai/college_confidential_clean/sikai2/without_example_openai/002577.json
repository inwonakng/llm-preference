Completely different reasons than the OP\u2019s. Aunt, Uncles and cousins live in Amherst, and he has interest in working near  the economic centers of Boston, Washington, NYC, Philly, etc. when he graduates. Seems Amherst would be better for that. He had moderate interest in Carleton till he visited. He was kind of knocked out by most of it. Hey, I wanted to go there! I think it\u2019s setting in rural MN is kind of a blessing. If it was in a more populated/warmer region I believe it would be overrun with applicants. Course, then the tenor of the school would probably change, and students and staff would start strutting around with their noses in the air. I don\u2019t think either school is a sports powerhouse, but would guess that Amherst is more accomplished in that area. Excuse the random musings. Carleton was actually the more expensive of the two when I ran the NPC's for our middle class income bracket, but it wasn't a large difference.   ```\n"
