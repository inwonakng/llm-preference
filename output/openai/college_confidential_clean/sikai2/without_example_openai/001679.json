Nobody gets promoted in high tech over someone else because of the undergrad college, it\u2019s the other things that people have mentioned - meeting product deadlines, leadership, managing change.  And even it it were determined a little by reputation, in silicon valley UM has a better reputation anyway.  ```\n"
