I thought I saw 20k for regional but not sure [/quote]  Assuming living on campus, mechanical engineering major, PSU Erie is $37,860 for out-of-state, while PSU Main is $48,268.  See https://cce.ais.psu.edu/tuition-calculator-ui/#!/ . Yes, you can complete a bachelor\u2019s degree in EE, IE, or ME at PSU Erie, according to http://main.abet.org/aps/AccreditedProgramsDetails.aspx?OrganizationID=55&ProgramIDs= .  However, the price is rather expensive if the intention is to transfer to PSU Main, using PSU Erie like a community college.  ```\n"
