You don\u2019t have any other schools offering merit aid that you are considering? Assuming not, Harvard doesn\u2019t seem affordable. I\u2019d be concerned about grade deflation at GA Tech for law and med school. But then again, you seem highly accomplished and likely will get great grades wherever. Given your two choices, I\u2019d pick GA Tech to avoid the large debt.  ```\n"
