Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```@helpless2017 Looking back at your questions and concerns about Olin (about its \u2018level of ubiquity\u2019 and concerns about standing out among your classmates, and your desire for research opportunities), I really think you are not the right fit for the school.  You will do yourself a favor if you pick GT since it meets all the things you have concerning Olin\u2019s culture.  Please don\u2019t take this as criticism. As others have said, it is about fit and culture.  You are a much better fit at GT than you would be at Olin.  ```\n"
