So 75% of students will be lower than that. While the 75% percentile is a bit lower for the whole UA student body, the honors and the NMF students that you will be taking classes with will have higher stats than that. You now need a 1480 plus SAT for the Presidential scholarship I think. In NY housing on or off campus will be very pricey. Take the money at UA and take advantage of all the opportunities it awards you. The money your parents save can be used for law school.  ```\n"
