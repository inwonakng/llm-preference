That alone accounts for a 3%-4% difference in pay. @Alexandre Your good at making stuff up and presenting it as factual. Also failing to normalize for size,  UMich has 5 times as many engineering students as Penn.  that would put Penn at nearly 200 vs 149 for UMich after a simple normalization, but I did meet a UMich grad working at the Genious Bar so Apple does hire them.  ```\n"
