If I think duke is great but not the be all end all that doesn\u2019t make me biased. It\u2019s called discerning.  My favorite nephew goes to Duke. I have no student there or Michigan and no student of mine has applied to either.  I have no mean boss from duke or was I ever jilted by a women from either. I\u2019m open to debate but you\u2019ve gotten a bit too personal and would suggest you move on. I will. My thoughts are generic. There are terms of service here and this has lasted one post too long.  ```\n"
