I\u2019m sure you know this, but thought it worth repeating that the school session is out for the Claremont Colleges and most students don\u2019t begin summer research until mid June or so. So the campus is going to feel really, really, empty. I believe most professors will be on campus and academic buildings should be open from 8-5- I\u2019d recommend emailing in advance to schedule a meeting (they might have some students as well that you could talk to). The admissions office does hold tours and info sessions at 9/10/11 AM and it could be a nice way to connect with the officers. Definitely make your way up to the other Claremont Colleges up north to get a sense of how close they are (also, if there are professors at the other schools whose work interests you, you could speak to them as well). The library should be open as well. Have a great visit   ```\n"
