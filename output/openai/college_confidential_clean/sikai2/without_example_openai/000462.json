And if you are indecisive now you may very well change majors.  My daughter just graduated college in a major she never heard of until after mateiculating.  My son is a senior and if not accepted to GT will be more than likely going to UGA.  As a GA parent I know kids from both these schools have excellent opportunities.  Life is short and college goesquickly pick where you will be happy.  When you are happy people tend to excel.  And remember there are highly successful people from all universities.  Its more what you make of it then where exactly you go.  And my daughtet said no way to ever going to grad school and is now getting her masters  ```\n"
