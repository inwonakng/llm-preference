If so isn\u2019t it informed thought to attend the school with the stronger students. Pejorative passive aggressive comments aside. Assuming you are in finance you know independent thought is only of value if the market ultimately arrives at your point of view.  Otherwise you may in fact own and undervalued asset forever never realizing the imbedded value your \u201cindependent thought\u201d recognized. In terms of college you can go to a college you think is better but if you are surrounded by students who went there as a second choice and or the reputation is inferior aren\u2019t you doing yourself a disservice? Cheers!  ```\n"
