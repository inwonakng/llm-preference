If you actually do, then don\u2019t go to Amherst.  It\u2019s a fantastic school for everything that it offers, and opens doors to graduate schools, professional schools, Wall Street, and other careers at the level of the Ivies, but it does not offer engineering.  If you want to be an engineer, go to Mudd. You need to make that decision first.  The rest will fall into place.  ```\n"
