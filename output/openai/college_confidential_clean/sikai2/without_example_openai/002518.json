You will get a lot of personal attention there and will undoubtedly form close friendships with people. LACs do make an effort to provide entertainment and actvivites. Maybe it willbe boring in occasion, but it\u2019s very tiresome being in a city 24-7. I think the quality of education will be better at MHC and I would choose it in your shoes.  ```\n"
