If you do go for it right after undergrad, your MBA from a not top-rated school with zero work experience will not be worth much.  If you are serious about getting an MBA, you\u2019d be better off working for a couple of years and then applying to higher rated programs.  Your employer may even pick up some of the costs.  ```\n"
