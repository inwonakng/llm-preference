[/quote]  Actually, there are some aspects of increased rigor at MIT, though not to the extreme of Caltech or Harvey Mudd.  These include: a.  First semester calculus (18.01) is basically equivalent to two semesters of calculus at most other schools. b.  General education requirements are extensive.  Many engineering majors may not like biology, but have to take it at MIT, unlike at other schools.  The humanities, arts, and social studies requirements are heavier than at many other schools.  ```\n"
