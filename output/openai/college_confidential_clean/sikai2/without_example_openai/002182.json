When I think \u201curban,\u201d I think \u201cinner city\u201d and when I think \u201curban campus\u201d I mean one that it within the inner city, especially if buildings are interspersed with city streets. Ultimately, it\u2019s all a matter of perspective \u2013 I grew up in Manhattan, and consider most \u201cmetropolitan\u201d regions in CA (except for downtown LA or downtown SF and a few scattered other cities) to be a series of concatenated suburbs, so everything\u2019s relative. And I agree with @TooOld4School. @CALSmom, and @rhandco \u2013 distance and logistics matter (more to some than others). These are all considerations when it comes to finding \u201cfit.\u201d  ```\n"
