If you guys are truly affluent and 260k is no biggie in the grand scheme of things, then sure go for MIT. If you are regular upper middle class where 260k is a big chunk of money for your family  and would materially impact your family budget, parents retirement plan etc then I d say UMich. Sure MIT has a much stronger name and is the ne plus ultra for engineering but it is not worth all the extra money if it will create issues for your family finances. Especially since Umich is an excellent school with a  top engineering program.  ```\n"
