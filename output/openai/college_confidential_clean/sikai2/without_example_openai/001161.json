But all of the schools you like are world class in every way including facilities. BC facilities keep getting better. Except some forced triples for freshman. The new rec center opening this fall and the new science center for 2019 are awesome. Unc was the same. When went I was more impressed with their campus than duke and that\u2019s rarefied air.  ```\n"
