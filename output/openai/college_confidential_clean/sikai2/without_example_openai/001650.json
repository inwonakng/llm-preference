He thought ND was a special place and kids really smart but a bit homogeneous.  He has loved uva and will be honored by living on the Lawn for senior year. As I said brother in law who is successful attorney loved ND and it\u2019s network has served him well. He is very proud to be a ND grad Bottom line is you can be super successful anywhere and these top schools offer unlimited opportunity.  Comparisons are interesting but not really super indicative  ```\n"
