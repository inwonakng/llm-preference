[/quote]  I wish I had taken better advantage of the opportunities I was offered at NC State. I also wish I had done a better job of seeking out friends. Both of those were my shortcomings though, not the school\u2019s (funny what a few decades of perspective can do). I did participate in the co-op program and it was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done.  ```\n"
