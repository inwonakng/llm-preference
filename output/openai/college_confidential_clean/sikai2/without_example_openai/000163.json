Your parents possibly can but I\u2019d thy dont have money now they\u2019re unlikely to have it in four years if they don\u2019t have it now + you said they didn\u2019t want to contribute. External scholarships tend to be small and are often just for one year. The best financial aid comes from the colleges - start rooting around your college and department at Pitt looking for scholarships. As a financial safety, apply to WCU and their honors college. Do apply to PHEAA.  ```\n"
