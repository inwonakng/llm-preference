Like I mentioned, I do think the current president has tempered the partying and there a lot of evening events. Re Deans list, just pride. When you go to a school with kids that are already pretty great students, it\u2019s nice to be in the top:-) I am hoping she might apply to be a Fulbright scholar. That would be awesome. D had seven scores of four or five, but they will give credit for a max of four. I think she got credit for French, Stats, English Lang, and Enviromental Sci. Not sure. She could have placed out of Intro Psych because she had AP psych, but chose to take it anyway. She is doing an Oscar Wilde seminar for short term. No idea why she chose that. There are more interesting offerings, IMO. I would have chosen roller coaster physics or gone away somewhere, myself! Re accepted students days, my D never cared for them. They are always a little artificial, no matter what school you visit. Her best visits were not at those events.  ```\n"
