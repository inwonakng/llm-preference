[/quote]  Your awareness of the possibility will serve you well though.  [quote] Rationally, I do know that the [academic] differences are essentially negligible [/quote]  Though you may have simply been making a concession to the thread with the above statement, you can find academically related factors that may indicate significant differences between your choices. Since this will be your decision, made with your priorities, you should feel free to consider the statistical attributes of these schools should this be of importance to you. For example, by 25th percentile ACT and SAT scores, Hamilton\u2019s student profile appears closer to that of Harvard or Stanford than to that of Bates. Should this be of importance? Not necessarily, but maybe. In any event, during your Hamilton visit, I\u2019d recommend you take a self-guided tour of their first-year housing options, particularly Wertimer, Wallace Johnson, South, North, Keehn and Major, even if this might mean separating yourself for a time from more structured events, @hopeful1660.  ```\n"
