Roughly $125,000 in earned income to achieve. If the $100,000 is not essential to your parents - emergency fund, retirement or for another child needing help for college in the future- then IU and Kelley School for a business career head start is better academically. UGA is pretty outstanding too. So if the facts above are not your family situation then UGA is the obvious choice.  ```\n"
