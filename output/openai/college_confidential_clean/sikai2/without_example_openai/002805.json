US News assesses a huge penalty to schools that report scores for less than a certain threshold of students. I\u2019m sure there are a few students who don\u2019t have scores to report, but overall one would expect Bates to have lower test scores than schools where everyone is submitting scores as a regular part of the application. The non-submitters have high high school GPA\u2019s so they\u2019ve demonstrated that they\u2019re strong students.  ```\n"
