Did you commit to both coaches in order to get their support?  Did you submit two SCEA/REA applications?  I\u2019m confused. In any event, my son was recruited by both and chose Princeton.  There will be a lot of athletes at either school, with more at Stanford but perhaps a higher percentage of the student body at Princeton.  Other than weather and your perception of your fit with the coach and team, I think the biggest difference is that, in contrast to Stanford\u2019s special academic hand holding of its athletes, Princeton tries to treat its student/athletes as students first and athletes second.  ```\n"
