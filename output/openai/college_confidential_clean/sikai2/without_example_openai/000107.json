NC State was like #10.   the most interesting part of that list assuming it is remotely accurate is it appears large state flagships clearly prepare people for the top jobs and they don\u2019t need to go to HYPM to get them. Also BME is notorious as a pre-med major. So it\u2019s not surprising they aren\u2019t really becoming software engineers.  ```\n"
