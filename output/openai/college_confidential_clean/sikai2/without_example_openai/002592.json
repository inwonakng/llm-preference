A few thoughts \u2026 Work study \u2026 You indicated that they find jobs for the kids. I don\u2019t remember that being the case for ds, especially after his first year. As a freshman, he worked in the dining hall, but I think that\u2019s because he wasn\u2019t aggressive in finding his own gig. Subsequent years, he found jobs that were more suited to his interests, though I will say that he loved even working in the dining hall. lol One thing I loved is how kids get paid. They can either take all the money, have their whole check credited to their student account or split it 50-50. I assumed every school did this, but that wasn\u2019t the case at ds2\u2019s university; as a result, I think the cash got squandered. Not so for ds1 \u2013 he had all his check rolled over into his account and was such a diligent worker that he got a fat refund when he graduated! He did study abroad junior year in a non-Carleton program. In addition to the Carleton-led options, there are scores of other options thanks to the consortiums to which Carleton belongs. Every year, there\u2019s a big study-abroad fair where kids can check out their choices, and that\u2019s how ds found his program \u2013  a semester in New Zealand. He absolutely loved it, including meeting kids from other colleges. Every year on his birthday, the first person on FB to post a msg is his host mom from Auckland. It\u2019s so fun to get that yearly reminder of his wonderful time there. The FA office was wonderful. Everything went really smoothly. He handled the whole thing, and it just couldn\u2019t have gone better. About ultimate \u2026 well, it\u2019s a thing at Carleton. If he doesn\u2019t want to play super-competitively, there\u2019s the Hot Karls, the developmental team. And, of course, the DIII team and the DI team. Just knowing that he played ultimate in HS makes me think that he belongs at Carleton!  Yes, Amherst has a team, too. But I\u2019m unabashedly biased.  ```\n"
