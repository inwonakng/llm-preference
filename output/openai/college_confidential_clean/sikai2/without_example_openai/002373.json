Admission to Amherst or HM is \u201cquestionable\u201d for virtually everyone. The admission rates at those schools are in the mid-to-low teens, and even extraordinarily well prepared students are rejected by the hundreds every year. Additionally, nearly half of the students at these top LACs are varsity athletes. Are you really suggesting that these talented young people can\u2019t handle sports and a pre-med major? Most would find that proposition laughable \u2013 my own son among them. Now if you\u2019re talking about DI athletics at the Big Ten or SEC level, then you may have a point. But these are D3 programs that work extraordinarily hard to create an environment where student athletes can flourish. And they do \u2013 often while juggling pre-med courses.  ```\n"
