Columbia is best in specialized theory areas at a graduate level, so for undergrad, that would make me lean more Michigan for a typical CS student. This thread has gotten way too sidetracked. Michigan is the obvious choice when it\u2019s so economically superior and arguably better in the subject being studied as a major. Michigan may not have all the qualities of an ivy, but in no way do those make up a difference of 100K or more.  ```\n"
