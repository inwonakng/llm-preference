Stern does very well but Wharton does open a few more doors and generally places better. The difference in placlement is probably not substantial enough to pay $184,000 when it creates a burden for your family. The MBA is interesting because it changes the cost dynamic somewhat. I don\u2019t know the actual numbers (OP could look them up if they care) but if 40% of Stern graduates get an MBA while only 20% of Wharton students do, then there\u2019s a 20% chance that Wharton further saves you around $400k all else equal. I agree with the above posts though, Stern is the safer path. For certain individuals and certain circumstances it would make more sense to attend Wharton given the edge in placement, MBA necessity, and preference for campus/culture, but it\u2019s dependent on the individual and is a riskier path to take. To be clear, I think In this case Stern seems like the better option unless OP really loves Penn, would consider switching majors potentially, and her parents are able to help with the cost without burdening themselves too much.  ```\n"
