Seems rather impossible any way one looks at it even if one assumes a reasonable number of those 820K came from abroad.  I like my alma mater and I know several successful graduates from it engineering and otherwise, but methinks that statement (whether PE or pe) is hogwash.  I\u2019m very curious as to what they\u2019re basing it on, but not curious enough to ask TBH.  If someone else did, I\u2019d love to read the answer though - or see the statement taken down.  False facts is one of my pet peeves no matter who says it.  ```\n"
