Even y-combinator reached out through another alumni. He is on their student advisory board. Look up what they do. They are a 50 billion dollar company that started, reddit, Uber, airbnb, drop box, stripe etc etc. Again, if you want things to happen then they will. Michigan is willing to give the resources. There are also ann arbor meet ups on various topics. These are student and company based and small groups. They were shocked their wasn\u2019t this type of tech group so they just started their own. University was 100% behind them and professors willing and excited to help. The old \u201cmake it and they will come\u201d philosophy\u2026 Lol.  ```\n"
