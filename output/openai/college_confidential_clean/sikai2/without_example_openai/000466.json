I have dozens of relatives in the Atlanta area. They do well, but don\u2019t live on West Paces Ferry or in Buckhead. And that amount is within their budgets without taking out loans or making any lifestyle changes. Very bright, hardworking people. But even they send their kids, for the most part, to UGA & Georgia Tech. Both UGA & Tech have a lot of sophisticated & bright students. And Atlanta is a great place for internships.  ```\n"
