You would probably apply for a job in the Atlanta, Charlotte, etc office. Work there 2 years and ask for a transfer to Chicago. A million years ago, I went to big SEC school, went to work for local office and then transferred to New York office. You could apply for a job directly to Chicago, etc office, but they will probably hire the people that had internships with them (and interns are usually from more local colleges). When I see the intern lists for Atlanta office, students are from Georgia State, UGA, Kennesaw, etc. Hope that helps!  ```\n"
