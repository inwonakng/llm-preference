I thought our job was to help them develop their list based on their criteria and our budget, and then let them pick the school that is right for them. Given that both of these schools are great, as are all of the top-15, I can\u2019t imagine there is a wrong choice unless it\u2019s not his. A happy kid at the #8, #10, or #12 ranked school is going to end up in a better place than an unhappy one at #2 - JMHO. My DD picked #12 Hamilton over # 7 Carleton because it was right for her - last I checked the Hamilton graduates are doing well as the Netflix Co-founder and the current Goldman Sachs Co-COO are graduates.  ```\n"
