Olin College of Engineering```\nCollege B: ```Georgia Institute of Technology```\nComment: ```I\u2019m beginning to get the picture that you feel better about GT, but have FOMO about Olin because it\u2019s so different. If Olin doesn\u2019t deeply resonate with you, I\u2019d be wary. It\u2019s a calling, almost like Deep Springs College. If you don\u2019t feel that, you could be miserable. There\u2019s higher risk at Olin. You will have to make your way more at GT than Olin, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It is, as many have pointed out, all about fit. Both are good schools.  ```\n"
