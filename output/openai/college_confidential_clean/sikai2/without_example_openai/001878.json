I know a few local Philadelphia kids who were accepted to Penn but not to Schreyer.  So its not just to make kids feel better.  Philadelphia area kids have an easier in to Penn.  1/3 of my son\u2019s graduating class will attend UPenn next year while only one or two (if that) were accepted to Schreyer.  ```\n"
