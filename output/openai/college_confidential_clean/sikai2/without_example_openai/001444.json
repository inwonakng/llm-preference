Unless your child is repulsed by Nashville and Vanderbilt, I fail to understand why there is even a question. Northwestern is not significantly more prestigious. They are not renowned for \u201cnatural sciences\u201d.  Vanderbilt has a first rate medical school and I can attest they are doing some really interesting and important research. Being close to the medical school is a huge plus. Your child might be able to shadow at Vandy Medical School or take some upper level courses or help with research over the summers. Additionally, and just as importantly, it is crazy competitive to get accepted to medical school right out of college. If she needs to work and gain extra experience to beef-up her application post BS degree, having contacts and connections at Vanderbilt is a huge plus. She might be able to get some great job for a year or two in one of their many specialty clinics while she studies for her MCATs and applies to med schools. The thought of my child being saddled with the cost of medical school at over 350K (not including the add\u2019l deferred interest costs if she choose to specialize in a field requiring many additional years of commitment) is not just concerning but flat out nauseating. One other factor, if she is the recipient of the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship, that is a feather in her cap for future admissions to graduate/medical school. So, I would counsel my daughter simply: \"\" if you got, use it!\"\".  In other words, take the darn scholarship! What are we missing?  Why is there even any question about not saving tuition costs now?  ```\n"
