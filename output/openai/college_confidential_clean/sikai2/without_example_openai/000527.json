Frankly, the only reason why we are talking about it is because the administration has put it out there as they are proactively addressing the issue. So many other colleges choose to sweep it under the rug and then it fails to be a topic of conversation on these threads. @apple23 And myself both have daughters who are not partiers and who were specifically seeking something other than that when choosing a college. It was a big factor in my daughter\u2019s decision as she wanted a place where she would fit in and find people she had things in common with. Whether or not students do choose to drink on the weekends, you will find that the typical Kenyon student did not come to Kenyon to party. She has met bright, articulate, friendly, warm, welcoming people there who are interested in thoughtful discussion rather than simply making small talk.  ```\n"
