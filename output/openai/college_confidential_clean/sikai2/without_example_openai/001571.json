The bigger financial play is medical school.  Medical school is running closer to 80,000 a year or more.  I would easily invest 60,000 to go to a university, Yale, that would carefully guide me through the medical school process with personalized advice and great classes to obtain a more affordable medical school education either by admission to one of the low cost great medical schools (Baylor or UT-southwestern) or to obtain quality financial aid or MERIT aid for medical school.  That is leaving aside the fact, left out of the advice here, that medical school admission rates at less than elite medical schools are running around 5% and even very strong students are being rejected.  If your dream is medical school, why wouldn\u2019t you invest 60,000?  ```\n"
