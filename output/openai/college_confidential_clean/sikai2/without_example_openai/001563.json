I suspect the opinions of an 18-year-old about \u201cliking\u201d or \u201cdisliking\u201d a particular U are based upon rather superficial factors and are not predictive of what his actual experience there would be. Every large University will offer a rich set of experiences, peers and opportunities. This young man may benefit from learning how to make the most out of the opportunities that present themselves rather than beginning this phase of life a sour grapes attitude. The opportunity to attend any of the extraordinarily high quality campuses in the UW system is extraordinary\u201d \u2014 I lifted that from another site and think it\u2019s insightful Personally I would go to Yale however.  ```\n"
