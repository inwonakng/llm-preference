Amherst will not include loans in your aid package but you can take as much as you want up to the direct loan max, to help with your family or student contribution, for example. D is not an athlete, loves her school, had an active social life that includes athletes and musicians and artists. The ultimate team there was the first one ever, and it is a club sport with two level teams so if he wants to play he can. Study abroad\u2026 Main thing to know is cost/financial aid is the same on campus or away. So he can choose whatever. D\u2019s academic experience has not felt competitive to her at all. She makes great use of office hours, reading and quant center, and other students. Sorry I know nothing about the physics Dept.  ```\n"
