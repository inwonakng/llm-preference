The same could be said for students decision criteria in choosing Princeton over Duke.\u201d Princeton is superior to Duke, Duke is not superior to Michigan. \u201cWhile wishful to think otherwise there does exist a pecking order driven by supply and demand. In this case consumers (students) choose Duke by a vast majority. Again both great schools but \u201cspeechless\u201d when being told Duke is more sought after or desirable then U Michigan\u2026 I believe willfull blindness is the correct term.\u201d There is no doubt that high school kids prefer Duke to Michigan. That is not in question. Like I said, with private universities exaggerating the benefits of attendance, such as halving their student to faculty ratios to improve their ranking, it is no wonder that impressionable high schoolers prefer Duke. Employers and academe (aka, graduate school admissions), on the other hand, are not impressionable. To them, Duke and Michigan are peer institutions.  ```\n"
