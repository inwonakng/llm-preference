However it is not particularly flexible for majors since you have to apply to the particular school you want to major in, and it is pretty focused once you are in it (ex. in the engineering school your first year courses are pretty much entirely for that major, so if you wanted to switch to polysci sophomore year, you\u2019d not only have to switch schools but be behind). For an undecided person, this could be a problem, combined with the low availability of aid for OOS students. On the other hand, NC State is bigger and has lots of major choices and social scenes. Raleigh is also an incredible location both for fun and for jobs/internships. Syracuse is much more difficult to get into, even being OOS for NCSU. I don\u2019t know much about the flexibility of Syracuse. If you want to know anything about NC weather or NCSU I can answer a lot, since I used to be rather obsessed with attending there.   ```\n"
