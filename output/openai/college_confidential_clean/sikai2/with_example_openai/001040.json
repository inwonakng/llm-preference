That is why it is not interested in playing the rankings game.  The rankings game is all about attracting a lot of applicants who - deep down \u2013 are more concerned with prestige than anything else. U. of Chicago was one of the most intellectual colleges back when it had 30% and higher admissions rates.  Students didn\u2019t apply there because of prestige \u2013 they applied there because they wanted that kind of education. Chasing prestige is fine and understandable.  But it isn\u2019t something that intellectual colleges care about.  ```\n"
