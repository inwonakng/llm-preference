VC, sure, but VC isn\u2019t engineering, it\u2019s business. Ditto investment banking. Having a technical background can help in those fields, but the work is COMPLETELY different. You can find any amount of self affirming data you want, if that\u2019s what you want, or you can simply ask the people who do the hiring. They hang out in the engineering forum. We might be able to summon some up if you don\u2019t want to move your post\u2026 @boneh3ad, @nordicdad, @ClassicRockerDad, @HPuck35, @cosmicfish, @ucbalumnus, @colorado_mom, @MaineLonghorn, @Gator88NE Good luck. You have lots of great options.  ```\n"
