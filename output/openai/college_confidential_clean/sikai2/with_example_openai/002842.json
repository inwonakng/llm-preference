Both provide excellent undergraduate educations that will prepare him well for graduate school, and both place many students in top law schools and MBA programs. If finances are a concern, go for the more affordable option, otherwise, visit both campuses and let him go with his gut. As for visiting him, I don\u2019t think UVa is easier. The most convenient way to get to Charlottesville from NYC is by car, a five and a half hour drive. The most convenient way to get to Ann Arbor from NYC is by plane, which also takes roughly five and a half hours door to door. It is more expensive to fly though!   ```\n"
