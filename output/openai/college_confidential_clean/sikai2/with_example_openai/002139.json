Ultimately, my best advise is to go with your own \u201cgut\u201d feelings. When my son was making his list of schools to apply to, we had a specific strategy with which then we prioritized based on my son\u2019s desired factors. The first and foremost was the institution\u2019s overall undergraduate quality and experience. While we don\u2019t take any college rankings seriously, it\u2019s really no surprise that Princeton comes in as a perennial #1 at each new publication of the USNWR. Princeton\u2019s students-to-teacher ratio of 5:1 is the best there is. Coupled that with their Preceptorial Method, which is a modified version of the Oxford tutorial, what you have is an outstanding undergraduate learning experience. By intention, Princeton has set their institutional focus on undergraduate more than graduate students. Their undergraduate population is only 5,232 while the graduate population is 2,747. Stanford, on the other hand, has about 2,000 more undergraduate population than Princeton and about 11,000 graduate population. Again, by institutional design, Princeton doesn\u2019t have Law, Medical and Business schools. Princeton\u2019s endowment per student is also perennially ranked #1 with $2.7M endowment per student, while Stanford is ranked #5 with $1.5M. And Princeton\u2019s alumni giving, an important signifier of undergrad student satisfaction, is also perennially at #1. Since you mentioned it, HYP has that elite \u201cIvy League\u201d prestige while Stanford has its own \u201cStanford prestige.\u201d While Stanford prestige might still grow and no matter how much it could possibly gain with time, it still isn\u2019t the same as the HYP\u2019s Ivy League mystique. And it\u2019s not like HYP and other Ivy League are at stand still while Stanford forges ahead leaps and bounds with prestige-building. It\u2019s not that my son and I don\u2019t like Stanford. When we made a priority list of colleges to apply to, Stanford was 4th on our list after HYP, and that was strictly based on our assessment of undergrad qualities and experiences. My son loves Princeton as the right place to get his undergrad degree while he\u2019s aiming at Stanford as one of top few grad schools to apply to. As an undergraduate-focused institution, my son would rather bet on the institution with 2,000 less undergrad students. Less chance to get lost in the shuffle. But these remarks are my and my son\u2019s take. Everyone\u2019s needs are different. Ultimately, as I stated at the very beginning, go with your own gut feelings after exhaustively investigating on undergrad quality comparisons. Good luck with your decision making. Either way, you\u2019ll be in a great place.  ```\n"
