I think with most things what you do matters much more than where you go but there are some exceptions. Harvard\u2019s neurosurgery residency program probably won\u2019t seriously consider an applicant who didn\u2019t attend a top medical school. Similarly, some VC firms virtually require their employees to have elite undergraduate degrees. It\u2019s probably also easier to excel as an undergraduate at an elite private school. Self-motivated students who are confident in their ability should definitely consider the state school option if it makes financial sense. Finally, the mediocre (3.4-3.7) Penn student has a much better shot of getting to HBS than the mediocre Alabama student.  ```\n"
