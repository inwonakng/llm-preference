I will say one thing - thjnk about how your son will get to campus. You haven\u2019t said what State you DO live in, but VT isn\u2019t that easy to get to. My son is twice as far and it\u2019s cheaper and easier to get him home from Miami. For DD, we have so far tried a plane, train, bus, and ride share. For us the bus to Allentown PA makes sense, but I still have to drive 1-1/2 hours each way to get her .  ```\n"
