Perhaps your parents are willing to part with your future inheritance in order for you to go to Yale and that is admirable. But the money is all in the same pool Assuming that you + parents are out zero for UW Madison x 4 years vs being out $240,000 for going to Yale for 4 years, in what way is that affordable? To put it in perspective, if you were to invest that amount of money (the 240K) at age 22 and earn 7% per year on average until you retire at age 65 you would be ahead $4.4 million! You are not likely going into medicine for the money, but money does matter. If you are a doctor and figuring out any job, any year, any change, etc. it will always matter to you. Obviously, Yale is Yale. And $4.4 million in retirement is $4.4 million. That is more than most doctors have in savings when funding their own retirements after a career of work. If you have children or spouse for whom you want to provide in the future, the decision is simple. UW is a good school and offers a lot of opportunities. Wisconsin also has two medical schools in state.  ```\n"
