My S started dating someone the summer before his senior year in high school, and they kept up a long-distance relationship all four years of college, and are still together (moved to the same city) post graduation. So he wasn\u2019t dating anyone at Bowdoin during his time there. My S is not outdoorsy at all, and was not an athlete, but he does love cold weather. He had never been in the state of Maine before he did a trip the summer before his senior year of high school, but fell in love with Bowdoin and applied ED. I think both schools are academic peers. My S did a minor in Government & Legal Studies (majored in History and a foreign language) and really enjoyed his time at Bowdoin. He is still on the east coast, finishing his second year of law school, and goes back to Bowdoin for homecoming and graduation.  ```\n"
