Now, the OP didn\u2019t say he\u2019s interested in banking. In fact, he clearly stated that he applied to, and got accepted onto, the engineering programs at both schools. Meaning to say, he\u2019s interested in acquiring an engineering degree. If later he decides to head to banking/finance, both schools can serve him that well, as records have shown it. But, what if he decides to stick to the engineering field, or become a startup founder or wants to work in SV? Will attending Duke be better of for him in any of those regard? I don\u2019t think so. In fact, I would politely argue that he will be putting himself in a disadvantage position given that that industry highly favors Cali schools, and Berkeley isn\u2019t only a highly favored school in SV, but is also positioned in the heart of the Bay Area, the center of where the action in the tech industry is.  ```\n"
