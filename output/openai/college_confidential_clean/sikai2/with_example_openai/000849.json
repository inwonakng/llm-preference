Sculley\u2019s tenure at Apple was not without its own share of controversy. And if we\u2019re going to list random CEOs, then Duke can claim the current CEO of Apple (the most valuable company in the world), the current CEO of P&G (10x more revenue than Uber), etc. Also, back to banking. I want to throw some more names out there. Steven Black (former co-CEO of JP Morgan). And this guy: http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-names-ashok-varadhan-sole-head-of-securities-2018-5 Ashok Varadhan (head of Goldman\u2019s trading business; one of the firm\u2019s youngest ever partners).  ```\n"
