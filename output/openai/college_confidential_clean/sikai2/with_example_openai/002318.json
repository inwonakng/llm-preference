[/quote]  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair assumption. Cornell and Penn have much better CS reputation in my experience, and Penn benefits from overrepresentation in the financial sector, even within tech. I think calling Michigan a top 5 school for CS is a reach, but I think it\u2019s safely a top 15 CS school. I don\u2019t think you can say the same about Columbia. The 5th in CS reputation is hotly debated on CC - I don\u2019t think going down this road accomplishes anything.  ```\n"
