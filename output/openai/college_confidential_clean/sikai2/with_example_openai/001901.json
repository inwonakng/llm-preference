At Alabama, you have a free ride to a very good education. School reputation is interesting and Jesuits are terrific, but the differences in education are not as different as you and others might think. You can fly to London probably through Atlanta because of the volume of national and international flights. Alabama is within driving distance to Florida, coastal Georgia, Nashville and Smokey Mountains\u2026There is lots to see and do in the South and some clear cultural, political and religious differences too. There are opportunities for internships in the South. An education in the South is not second class unless you don\u2019t apply yourself academically or spend too much time socializing. Football in the South is competitive and fun. Finally, I can\u2019t imagine asking my parents to spend $60000 tuition. What are you willing to let parents and siblings give up because of your tuition? Finally, a free ride is a luxury that allows you to travel, study, invest in your education, and sort out your adult life. There is serenity and satisfaction earning an education without worrying about money. Try the South. It is an opprtunity, not a prison sentence.  ```\n"
