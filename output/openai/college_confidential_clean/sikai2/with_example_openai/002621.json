I never said Penn wins the cross-admit battle against Yale, i simply said that it gets a sizable piece, 50%- 30% is a sizable piece. Also yes a lot of it is Wharton but it is not only Wharton. With Harvard & Stanford it is practically only Wharton and dual degrees, with Yale it is engineering students as well. I never said the choice between the two schools should be based solely on the difference in bioengineering. but i just laid out the fact that Penn has consistently been ranked higher for bioengineering, medical school and its hospitals and tends to get more research funding in the field. But i do agree with you that it is not a substantial difference.  And definitely not a substantial difference to base a choice of college on. If you have noticed i keep emphasizing fit to the OP in every other post, as i think this is the main consideration.  ```\n"
