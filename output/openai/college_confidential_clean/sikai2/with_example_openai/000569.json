One great thing about Cornell engineering is that it is 50% female, which is unusual for an engineering school. My D is a freshman MechE major at Cornell and absolutely loves it.  Cornell has so many opportunities to get involved, especially for engineers. She is heavily involved in one of the big project teams, which had given her a great network of friends from all years, as well as real hands-on engineering training.  Cornell has a very strong alumni network as well, especially in the NY area.  I\u2019m an alum myself, and spend a lot of time mentoring recent Cornell grads who want to go into my field. D also looked at RPI but was wary of the lopsided gender ratio, and its extreme tech focus (even the \"\"liberal arts\u2019 requirements are tech classes).  I don\u2019t know much about VaTech. $30K is a big chunk of money though - only you can decide whether it will be worth it. Edit -  Is that $30K total or $30K per year?  If that is per year, then that is a much bigger consideration - not sure Cornell is worth $120K more over those other schools.  ```\n"
