That is the only reason that this thread exists. But at IU-Kelley & Hutton Honors College & Business Honors, you will get a much different experience than your other options. If the difference in cost will necessitate taking out loans of any amount, then go to UGA for room & board. But, if the cost is not a substantial concern to you & your family, then you have a choice to make based on other factors. P.S. Again, you have verifiable numbers & placement info. about IU-Kelley. And an available resource in @iubaccounting for accurate up-to-date information. Use those resources when deciding about your future.  ```\n"
