But they are very different schools that will provide you a very different college experience.  UMich draws 100k for a football game; Columbia 1k.  Very apples to oranges. UMich at in-state prices is an outstanding cost/value proposition, especially for engineering.  But your parents are willing/able to pay for either.  So the cost is the same to you.  That\u2019s a very fortunate spot to be in. Life is short.  Go where your heart tells you to go.  If Columbia is the experience you really really want, then go to Columbia. Don\u2019t get overly hung up about rankings.  Columbia comp sci is quite good (ranked about the same as UMich at the grad school level).  Neither UMich or Columbia is at the MIT level for comp sci.  You can bloom if planted in either place. You haven\u2019t told us enough about what you mean by \u201cgrad school\u201d so we have no way of evaluating whether there\u2019s value in conserving cash for that.  Grad school typically costs little.  Professional school (totally different ballgame) is very expensive.  If you are talking about non-professional grad school, conserving the college fund by going to UMich most likely means that the money would get used for something other than your post-grad education \u2013 like a college fund for your siblings or your kids or a house down payment. If you are talking about getting an MBA when you say \u201cgrad school\u201d, then I\u2019d say save the money and go to a place like Columbia for B school.  ```\n"
