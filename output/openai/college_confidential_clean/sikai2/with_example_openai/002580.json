Yes, some avoid humanities or social sciences, but not nearly as many.\u201d That may be true.  It doesn\u2019t change the fact that the students at Amherst who DO choose to do science and math fare very well and have excellent opportunities and college support for further academic study like PhDs, for medical school and other professional schools, and for recruiting to businesses.   Forbes just ranked Amherst No. 1 in the nation on its list of Private Colleges Worth Every Penny. https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliesportelli/2017/04/26/10-expensive-colleges-worth-every-penny-2017/#5943768d5f6a Again, I want to emphasize that Carleton is also an excellent school and would be a great option.  ```\n"
