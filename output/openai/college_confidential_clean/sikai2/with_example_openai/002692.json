And where you can get the most opportunity to do research and intermships. Pitt is known for excellent sciences and has the Universy of Pittsburgh medical center right on campus for easy opportunity and access to gain experience through shadowing, research or internships. Yale students are generally brilliant so the question is if your competition are geniuses will you be able to do as well in the premed coursework there as at Pitt? And compete with them for internships, research opportunities?  This is not at all to belittle the quality of students at Pitt, which are of excellent quality too, but you can\u2019t compare the selective admissions process of Yale vs Pittsburgh. I hear anecdotally that the premed curriculum at Pitt is very rigorous and achieving high grades there will be difficult as well. You should try and speak to some premed students at both schools and find out how good are the premed professors at each school and how are the grading practices is each. Sometimes the grading at the more selective school, such as Yale,  is higher than at a less competitive school, particularly a state school where professors seek to weed out a majority of the class.  This could help you make the decison. Med schools don\u2019t care so much what undergrad school you go to as much as how you do in the sciences and what experience you obtain, showing a demonstrated interest in medicine. However if you decide to switch out of premed then Yale would provide more opportunity in my opinion. Also ask yourself if you thrive better as a big fish in a little pond (I.e., at Pitt)  or not?  ```\n"
