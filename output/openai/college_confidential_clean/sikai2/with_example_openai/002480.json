Of the 20+ graduates in 2013, they all got into companies like Google, Amazon and Apple or the equivalent. I happened to know many of them and they are very bright kids with a lot of CS background on their back before entering UofC. Since then, the class has grown 3 fold until today.  Don\u2019t worry about academic excellence at UofC, except Chicago does not have an Engineering Department.  ```\n"
