We could be nitpicking league tables just to win in an argument, when in fact, there is very little that separates between them, unlike in engineering where Berkeley is considered part of the \u201choly trinity\u201d, standing alongside MIT and Stanford. And, for the record, I did not present those rankings to tell anyone on here that Berkeley is superior to Duke for banking/finance, but to disprove anyone who claims Berkeley would be a terrible training ground and feeder school to banking/finance. I agree Duke is a fantastic school, as a whole. In the same way that I agree Yale, for instance, is an amazing school, in general. But those schools have weaknesses and engineering happens to be the worst of them. Coincidentally, engineering happens to be Berkeley\u2019s one of its strongest departments, and Berkeley \u2013 its name \u2013 is highly reputable, not only in America but throughout the whole universe. Duke, though good as a whole, doesn\u2019t enjoy such grandiose reputation as Berkeley\u2019s, specially in the tech universe. In fact, for many, many serious and highly dedicated, extremely talented engineering aspirants, Duke is not on their radar. If we\u2019re talking about WS, I agree Duke has more presence there. But we\u2019re not talking about WS, are we?  ```\n"
