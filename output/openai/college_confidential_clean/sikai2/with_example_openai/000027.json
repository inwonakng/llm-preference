She went to visit all 3 schools ( and a few others) and made a list about what she liked about them and where she could see herself over the next 4 years.  She ultimately ended up choosing University of Maryland since they had given her a full ride and she knew she wanted to continue her studies in grad school when she finished undergrad and didn\u2019t want a huge amount of debt.  Each of the 3 programs are very strong and each campus has their strengths. Your son should try to choose where he feels will be the best fit for him not only academically but socially too.  When your son visits I suggest he also tries to sit in on a class or 2 to see what the academics are like.  ```\n"
