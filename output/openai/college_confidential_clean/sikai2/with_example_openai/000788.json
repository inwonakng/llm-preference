At google, it is extremely difficult to break into deep mind unless you have graduate schooling or prior AI knowledge which is just simply not provided at the undergrad level.  This is not even taking account changes such as blockchain that is being introduced more at the grad level as well.  So exposure in this category will deepen your expertise and will be helpful in getting you to the right group within google AI or FAIR (Facebook\u2019s AI group) should you choose that path. As for cutthroat competition, it is a myth and frequent rumor mill spread by people who did not get in or go tot hopkins.  People study together.  When you go to the library or dorms, you will frequently find study groups. They compete together against the tests and not against each other since the school does not have grade inflation.  When you ask the source of these cutthroat rumors, they are time and time again by non Hopkins alums.  This goes for the premeds as well.  Ask current Hopkins students if it is cut throat there before passing judgement. I personally had a blast and met my best friends at Hopkins.  We had a great time partying, hanging out in fells point close to the harbor, going to DC, chilling at federal hill and around mount Vernon in Baltimore as well.  My friends and I all graduated while having great social lives and are all now doing well as doctors, engineers, lawyers etc etc.  ```\n"
