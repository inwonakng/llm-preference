If $25,000 per year is an amount that can be handled by you & your family without difficulty or loans, then the benefits of the Hutton Honors College at IU, the benefits of Business Honors at IU-Kelley and the benefits of Direct Admission to a major US undergraduate business program (IU-Kelley) are worthy of serious consideration. Also, admission to UGA Honors College in the second year is not assured even if one meets or exceeds the 3.80 UGA GPA requirement.  ```\n"
