You asked if I liked UGA.  Yes, I did love UGA and the accounting program set me up for success, but that was 27 years ago and I am not you. After reading all of the new posts I have to reiterate what I posted earlier.  For accounting there is not an academic difference in these two schools.   Employers have been hiring from these two schools for decades and have been shaping the curriculum for decades, and that gives the programs a trade school like feel.  Rankings matter, but when you drill down to something specific like accounting it\u2019s more about your chances of landing a great first job.  Both schools will be heavily recruited by top accounting/consulting firms. MBAs were mentioned earlier, and I would recommend not considering that.  I would recommend a masters in accounting, and then after a few years out in the real world decide if you want an MBA.  Both schools will allow you to attend an excellent MBA program. What brought me back to this thread was that I had dinner last night with the IU grad mentioned above.  We both agreed that within accounting groups our degrees are respected, but outside of that group it\u2019s just a business degree from a state school.  Both of us loved our time in college and feel like it set us up for success. Good luck in your search!  ```\n"
