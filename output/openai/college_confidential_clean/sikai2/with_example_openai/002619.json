I definitely agree with you that a lot of the cross admits Penn is able to attract is due to Wharton, never disputed that. For undergrad both overall undergraduate quality/ standing and specific departmental strength matter. This is why it is not uncommon for people to choose Penn or Yale over much better engineering schools like Gtech and UIUC. I agree the difference it is not big, but it is there. Regarding medical school/hospital, by the sam logic Yale law and Penn Law are both top 10, caN one say that there is so difference? Same for Wharton vs SOM. Sure for medical school and hospital strength the difference is not big but it is there.  ```\n"
