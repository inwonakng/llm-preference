The first year of Dartmouth gets treated as a study abroad year. In Hamilton\u2019s case, the cost of attending Dartmouth was about $3K more, so we were responsible for the additional $3K. In the 5th year of the program the student becomes a Dartmouth student where they are then subject to Dartmouth FA. Just want to point out that the curriculum at Hamilton is definitely challenging and will prepare your son well to take on the challenges at Dartmouth, perhaps better than some of the other schools. My son was able to get waived out of two courses and ended up taking more advanced alternatives at Dartmouth. I don\u2019t know the reason for this but it seems, at least for now, that more students pursue this program from Colby, Skidmore and Vassar than from Hamilton. Best of luck to your son.  ```\n"
