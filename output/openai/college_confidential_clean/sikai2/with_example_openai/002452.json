I would say Syracuse has a lot to do, sure. I would also say that if you\u2019re a southerner you need to be prepared that lake effect snow is not kidding around. It will snow a lot. A LOT. It will be very cold and windy, like from October until April. If you\u2019re not prepared for that sort of weather, I\u2019d mark it off your list. (I grew up nearby so it wasn\u2019t a huge change for me, but coming from the south I imagine it would be a huge shock.) I also didn\u2019t find Syracuse all that public-transportation-friendly, but things may well have changed since I was there. My most vivid memory of my time there was walking up to campus to take the GRE on a Saturday when the wind chill was something like 30 below zero. I lived three blocks from the building where I took the test and when I got there I was afraid I had frostbite. (I was fine.) It\u2019s a great school, don\u2019t get me wrong. But the weather is nuts.  ```\n"
