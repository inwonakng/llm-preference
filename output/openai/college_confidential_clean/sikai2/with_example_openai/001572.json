My D. seriously considered UNC for bio and got impression that intro classes would be somewhat impersonal, large, and very tough.  Prolly similar to Madison. (She ended up choosing an LAC) Of course all colleges want high med acceptance rates so I imagine they all weed out to an extent at the front end, even Yale.  But just seems like Yale might be more supportive environment.  But 60k is a lot to pay for that. . .  ```\n"
